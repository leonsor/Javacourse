8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,556
PROFESSOR: Are you guys
excited about Battlecode?

9
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm so excited to
see this many-- Yeah!

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,245
Yeah, let's hear a
hurray-- no, no a yeah.

11
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:39,370
Are you excited?

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,730
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,350
PROFESSOR: All right,
that was a strong yeah.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,590
I actually mean that.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,716
I have a strange thing
where when I say something

16
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:52,389
it often comes out like I meant
the opposite of what I said,

17
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:53,430
like I didn't believe it.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,420
Like that time that Drew
Houston-- from Dropbox,

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,610
he's the Dropbox CEO-- do
you guys remember this?

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,390
He was giving his sponsor talk
at the finals of Battlecode

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,952
last year and he was
just wrapping up,

22
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,410
and everybody was
applauding, and I

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,740
came to the podium I was
like, thanks, thanks Drew.

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,110
That was really good.

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,640
That made me want
to work at Dropbox.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,340
If I didn't have a
job already I would.

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,840
And nobody believed
me, they thought

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,930
I was just being facetious.

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,924
So, now he hates me.

30
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,390
That's too bad.

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,640
That happens to me.

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,790
OK, let's get started soon.

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,710
So you're all here
because you're

34
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,600
interested in Battlecode.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
These lectures are optional.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,820
They're geared at beginner
to mid-level coders,

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,950
but they'll be
relevant even if you've

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,930
had coding experience
in a million languages.

39
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,490
Because we're
going to be talking

40
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,000
a lot of the time about
Battlecode, the game itself.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,380
And it could just be a
way to keep yourself up

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,260
to date on the latest
metagame, for example.

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,870
So we're going to go
over the specs today.

44
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,150
I'm going to introduce
the competition.

45
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,979
And then after
lecture today, we'll

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,934
be having a lab, during
which we'll help you set up.

47
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,100
So I see a lot of you brought
your computers, that's

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,500
fantastic.

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,300
And that's also great because
it means if you get bored,

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,050
you can just watch
YouTube videos.

51
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,800
Yeah, so make sure to bring
your ear plugs so that you don't

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,060
bother the guy next to
you, because he's already

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,080
heard Gangnam Style.

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,120
All right so be
respectful of those guys.

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,520
So here's our introduction.

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:46,390
My name is Maxwell Mann, I'll
be your lecturer for the next 10

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,390
days.

58
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,570
It actually is minus 4 days
because of various things.

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,670
So it's like the
next two weeks, you

60
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,510
can come here at this
time-- or slightly earlier,

61
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,600
so you can hear a lousy
joke --you can come here,

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,050
and you can hear me
talk about the game,

63
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,340
and hear what the
devs think about what

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,840
you might need to know.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,190
And then you can eat
food at 6:00 PM, when

66
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,650
we have massive
quantities of food coming,

67
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,040
and then from 6:00 to
7:00, you have the option

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,150
of staying for the lab session,
which has been described,

69
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,120
in anticipation,
as a social utopia.

70
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,800
And I really believe
that it could be one,

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,520
because everybody here has,
sort of, some similar interests.

72
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,300
So to introduce
us, we developers,

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,300
are students, or
alums, who have worked

74
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,650
on developing Battlecode.

75
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm Max.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,010
Sitting here in the
front is Aaron Epstein

77
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,930
and Steven Valdez.

78
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,440
You'll be using them for help,
all the time, if you need it,

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,950
or just to bother them
because you feel like it.

80
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,840
They're here for
no other reason,

81
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,850
and to maintain the code base
and these kinds of things.

82
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,200
The website is battlecode.org
and we have a forum there,

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,030
where you could
also go to get help.

84
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,230
And I also,
particularly, would like

85
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,840
to direct your attention
to the IRC channel.

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
It's #battlecode on Freenode.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,930
So I don't know if
you know what that is,

88
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,200
but it's basically
a way that you

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,620
can talk to us on
a real time chat.

90
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,100
So you can do that at pretty
much any hour of the day,

91
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,690
because the way
we're setting it up

92
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,807
this year is we'll all
be available, pretty

93
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:33,640
much the whole time.

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,750
OK, make sure that if
you are an MIT student,

95
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,250
and you want credit
for this class--

96
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,920
it's a six credit
class --you just

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,780
have to sign up on
WebSIS for 6.S187.

98
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,170
How many people have signed
up on WebSIS already?

99
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,050
All right, that's
like everybody.

100
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,260
Let's talk about the
goals of the competition.

101
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,690
What is a game?

102
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,690
What are we doing?

103
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm sure a lot of you are
thinking all right, well, here

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,840
we go.

105
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,330
I've got finals
tomorrow but I have

106
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,510
to decide what IAP
classes to take.

107
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,106
Gosh, this is a terrible
combination of deadlines.

108
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,480
Then you thought,
should I take--

109
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,390
should I to do battle code?

110
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,170
Should I do one of these other
things, like web programming,

111
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,080
or game programming?

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,190
What is the operating
systems whatshumadoosits?

113
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,410
Should I do this or that?

114
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,150
And you're probably thinking
to yourself, what is fun?

115
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,230
What is valuable for me?

116
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,630
What am I going to learn?

117
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,600
And we ask ourselves
the same question.

118
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,890
A couple months
before then was, what

119
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,470
do we want the Battlecode
competition to be like?

120
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,860
And what we ended
up deciding, was

121
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,480
that the game needs
to be fun and it

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,290
needs to contain classic
battle code areas of challenge

123
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,570
in artificial intelligence.

124
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,130
So this is a game that
is a cross-- we've always

125
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,880
said in the past that
it is not StarCraft

126
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,870
--but it is a cross between
a real-time strategy

127
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,000
game and an AI
programming competition.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,250
So what we wanted was the
game to be easy to learn,

129
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,540
but hard to master.

130
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,710
So what you'll see when I
describe the game specs--

131
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,730
and I'm going into it just
momentarily --when I describe

132
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,540
game specs you'll see ways
to play the game, and then

133
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,250
ways to excel at the game.

134
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,820
So it's like you've got
this infinite ramp, that you

135
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,360
can run wild on, of
how much effort you

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,990
want to put into
developing the best player.

137
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,060
Or better yet, because
what is the best?

138
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,160
It's comparative.

139
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,690
That's comparing
to somebody else.

140
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,780
But that's kind of irrelevant.

141
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,988
What you want is to have fun.

142
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:34,435
Anyway, you know that.

143
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,060
So there we go.

144
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,290
Our idea was to not
have sort of skill caps

145
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,060
and limiting factors,
like maps that are just

146
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,420
covered in maze so
you can't do anything

147
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,850
unless you can get
past that maze.

148
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,120
Like, OK, you didn't
pass the test,

149
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,280
I hope you enjoy
your starting area.

150
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,870
No, no.

151
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,550
So not that.

152
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,550
So let me show the game.

153
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,830
How many of you have
seen Battlecode before?

154
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,140
A show of hands.

155
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,400
So that's a good number,
but it's not everybody.

156
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,860
So I'm going to show you a game.

157
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,080
So this is when
you've made your code

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,555
and you've put it
into the client,

159
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:09,180
you can run a game
like this, and we'll

160
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,756
go over how to do that.

161
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:12,380
And I'll just hit
play here, and you'll

162
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,870
see the red team
in the upper left,

163
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,580
and the blue team
in the bottom right,

164
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,030
playing a game of
Battlecode for this year.

165
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,750
The player on the
upper left, in red,

166
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,170
is placing mines,
and capturing bases.

167
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,520
His soldiers are moving around
and fighting with one another.

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,250
Fighting the enemy, hopefully.

169
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,560
And the blue player,
here at the bottom right,

170
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,380
is just sort of
shooting his guys off

171
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,120
to die at the enemy army.

172
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,490
On the left you'll
see indicators

173
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,600
of various game constants
and values that are changing.

174
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,290
If I pause this
for a second, you

175
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,190
can see by clicking
on any robot,

176
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,030
you can see his ID number,
what robot type it is.

177
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,700
You can see his hit
point level, which

178
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,720
we have characteristically had
a very difficult to remember

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,257
name for.

180
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:03,840
We always have different names
for their energy and their head

181
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,070
points this year it's going to
be, "energon," for hit points.

182
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,230
I think this flux number is
actually no longer relevant,

183
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,538
and you can ignore it.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

185
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,290
PROFESSOR: See,
we worked so hard

186
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,500
on making this
polished and perfect,

187
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,639
that we weren't finished
until-- actually we're

188
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,930
not finished yet, they're
still fussing with something.

189
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,660
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

190
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,710
PROFESSOR: The
bytecodes used is going

191
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,490
to be a key factor that you're
going to look at so that you

192
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,159
can determine how much
computational energy

193
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,679
those robots are spending.

194
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,179
This year, there's
a very big impact

195
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,919
on the efficiency of your
code, and the performance

196
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,840
of your player.

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,560
If you have efficient code, you
could have twice as many robots

198
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,210
on the field then
you can sustain

199
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,710
if your code is inefficient.

200
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,980
Because the actual
computational cost

201
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,600
is recorded, and
is then implemented

202
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,620
into the upkeep of each unit.

203
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,250
Finally, you'll see the
location of the unit, and three

204
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,850
indicator strings that you can
use for debugging and control

205
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,440
purposes.

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,630
So what we'll do today is talk
about what kinds of things

207
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,550
are on this map, and how that's
different and amazingly great,

208
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,180
and how this year's new gameplay
will be even more fun than it

209
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,430
ever has been.

210
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,040
And I can say that
with some confidence,

211
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,710
because it's quite different
and demonstrably better.

212
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,120
Yes.

213
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,710
So what we think of
as skill areas, areas

214
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,570
that make a fun
game for Battlecode,

215
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,285
are, navigation-- but not
that you so much require

216
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,480
it --see, in this example,
they didn't really

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,350
need any complex maze
solving algorithms.

218
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,470
What they were just doing, is
there are these neutral mines

219
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,784
that are here, and you
could either walk around

220
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:50,450
the neutral minefield,
or you could just

221
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,908
clear yourself
right on through it.

222
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:54,120
So there's navigation,
but you don't necessarily

223
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,750
have to do it.

224
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,470
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

225
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,900
PROFESSOR: There's
group pathing--

226
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,812
and that's a good point
because, you know,

227
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:05,240
OK, anybody can take one
unit and after enough time,

228
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,810
figure out how to implement
any of the existing pathing

229
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,440
algorithms.

230
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,550
But let's say you've
got multiple units.

231
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,550
They start to get in
one another's way.

232
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,910
Let me give an example
that's very concrete,

233
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,220
and that hits really
close to home, for me.

234
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,960
I did this all the time--
I've done Battlecode,

235
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,980
I guess, like four years now.

236
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,900
And so what I'd always
have is, I'm here,

237
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:33,430
and I want to go to ice
cream-- something desirable

238
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,310
--and I'm trying to
get past this wall.

239
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,760
So I go here, but then all my
friends take up all this space

240
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,470
because they're
going the same way.

241
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,014
And then I'm trying to
turn around, and go back,

242
00:10:43,014 --> 00:10:44,930
and they're trying to
go this way because they

243
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,990
think it's closer
to the ice cream.

244
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,890
And we just end up here
all day, and then the enemy

245
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,020
comes by and shoots us.

246
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,370
And then we've got
holes in ourselves,

247
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,460
how are we going to
maintain that stomach

248
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,650
area to keep the ice cream in?

249
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,980
It's just not going to work.

250
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,340
So we like navigation,
we like group pathing.

251
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,390
We like messaging.

252
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,190
This year, the messaging
system is totally new.

253
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,304
In the past, what
you'd need is--

254
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm going to go
back to the screen

255
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,840
here --is your
robot would only be

256
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,230
able to see a certain
area around himself.

257
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,900
And so every other
robot would not

258
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,440
know what's going on, on the
whole map, except by messaging.

259
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,630
But even then, they would
have to receive messages

260
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,622
that are broadcast
within a certain range.

261
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,830
So you end up having to make
these chains where you'd

262
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,960
say, all right,
I've got, let's see,

263
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,430
Joe, and James, and Jalopy.

264
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,080
They're all in line, and these
three robots are in line,

265
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,430
and they each have
some broadcast radius.

266
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,370
And so maybe I can, sort
of, set up a relay chain,

267
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,100
and they're broadcasting back.

268
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,640
And that was how you used
to communicate information

269
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,960
about where the enemy is.

270
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,810
So here's the ice cream,
here, and here's me.

271
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,100
And I would have to hear
it from these four guys.

272
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,027
But that would end up
being a lot of work

273
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:03,860
for me to implement.

274
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,360
And we like that, we
think that's really cool.

275
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,140
But at the same time
it ended up meaning

276
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,150
that if the ice
cream were an enemy,

277
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,710
and I needed to scout
that the enemy were coming

278
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,874
with some rush, that
what would often happen

279
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:20,790
is that there wouldn't
be a chain established.

280
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,860
Because this kind of
stuff's kind of hard do.

281
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,807
So this guy would see the enemy
right here-- and here's me,

282
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,640
back here, I'm just
minding my own business.

283
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,700
Maybe I'm building a staircase,
which we did in one year.

284
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,440
Or some other very useful
expenditure of effort and time.

285
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,030
So this guy sees the enemy
and I don't know about it,

286
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,810
I can't prepare
until he comes back.

287
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,590
OK, so then he comes back
to within broadcast range--

288
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,850
he's here --but by then
the enemy is right there.

289
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,390
I can't do anything.

290
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,550
So what we've done
this year, is we've

291
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,630
said all right, realistically
we've got these radios, right?

292
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,050
Let's communicate, on these
radios, across the whole map.

293
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,260
So now your radio messages can
be heard across the whole map.

294
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,242
But, instead of being messages,
like they used to be--

295
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,950
and these messages
were kind of annoying,

296
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,790
they were these constructs
that you had to assemble.

297
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,920
You'd say, oh, I'm
making a new message

298
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,770
and I'm applying
these parts to it.

299
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,860
And not every message
has every type of part.

300
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,904
And not every part as
every type of message.

301
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,320
And every time I
receive a message

302
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,460
I can receive an
infinity of messages.

303
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,550
And then my robot
explodes because he's

304
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,260
being overloaded with messages.

305
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,020
That's like spam, happens
a lot, it happens to me.

306
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:33,570
So what we get instead,
is we said, all right,

307
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,580
we've got a uniform
message channel.

308
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,320
We've got 10,000 channels.

309
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,370
And any robot can
post an integer

310
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,240
to any one of those
channels, at any time.

311
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,120
So then my robot could be
posting-- maybe my code

312
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,530
is using frequency 567.

313
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,330
And I'll be communicating on
that frequency specifically

314
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,312
where I'm going, or what
direction I'm going,

315
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:55,270
or something like that.

316
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,220
And everybody on
my team can see it.

317
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,330
So that's a really useful
sort of centralizing feature.

318
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,900
So if the enemy is
coming, I can just

319
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,760
look on integer number 567, and
if the enemy is coming, maybe

320
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,510
that's a flag,
maybe I make that, I

321
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,890
guess, 666 because
that's really bad.

322
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,500
Right?

323
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,990
So I make that my token for
enemy is coming, and then bing,

324
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,100
everybody can start preparing
for the enemy coming.

325
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,660
But there's more,
I mean, let's say

326
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,910
you're going to metagame them.

327
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,150
You're going to think about what
could happen from a high level.

328
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,940
Like when would the
enemy just invade?

329
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,740
When would they attack me?

330
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,580
I mean, I don't have to see them
coming to know that they will.

331
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,350
For example, maybe the
map is really small.

332
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,790
So this year, you can
tell how big the map is.

333
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,410
I mean, how does it make sense--
this happened again and again

334
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,680
in previous years --how
does it make sense

335
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,600
to have a game, where players
are expected to operate

336
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,590
intelligently, in the
absence of information.

337
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,520
OK, I understand that sometimes
a little bit of uncertainty

338
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,190
can be great.

339
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,290
Like how great poker
be if everybody

340
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,830
knows what everybody
else's hand is?

341
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,690
That would be
really lousy, right?

342
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,490
But here, we just had
almost no information,

343
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,080
so you'd have
build-order losses.

344
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,770
This is sort of a big problem,
in my eyes, with StarCraft.

345
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,300
Which is that you'd start
with a strategy that

346
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,360
could lose before you have any
information on how to fix that.

347
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,580
So at least in StarCraft
you know how big the map is.

348
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,400
So here we're giving them
the following centralized

349
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,300
information.

350
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,800
So here's what I'll do.

351
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm going to list out the
centralized information

352
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,230
that you can use, that
you didn't really used

353
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,820
to have access to.

354
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,714
Now you might ask, all right
I'm not going to memorize this,

355
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:51,380
and I'm not taking
notes-- even though I

356
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,840
did bring a thingamabober, which
is a computer, or a notebook.

357
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,040
You might say, I'm not
going to memorize this,

358
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm not interested,
I'm here to have fun.

359
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,430
Well look here, you can
look in the Java docs

360
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,820
and you can see all of
the robot abilities.

361
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,029
They're listed in
this giant list here,

362
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,570
and you'll have time
to peruse those.

363
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,510
And we'll sort of go
over them over the course

364
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,180
of the few lectures.

365
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,220
But having them sort
of in a condensed form

366
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,400
or organized into
topics, like what

367
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,900
is centralized information?

368
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,630
You know, what
information can I use?

369
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,110
Ends up probably being
a bit of a convenience.

370
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,760
So I have a couple of convenient
organizations of data.

371
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,750
And that's really all
I'm here for is just--

372
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,720
you can get all this information
in our documentation,

373
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,930
which we'll supply you when
we help you set up the game.

374
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,240
And/or you can sort of hear
it from me, where I've got it

375
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,220
sort of organized into a
slightly different way.

376
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,550
The centralized
info that you get

377
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:55,510
includes, you can sense the
positions of all allied robots.

378
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,150
So there's a function, and
again, we have very good naming

379
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,800
conventions so that all
of the names that we pick

380
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,560
let you know exactly
what we're referring to.

381
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,510
And for this function we call
it-- it's a method called,

382
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:16,700
"Sense Nearby Game Objects."

383
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,359
And that's great because
it can detect game objects

384
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,579
across the map, anywhere,
they don't have to be nearby.

385
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,390
So that that's really nice.

386
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,590
And it senses these things,
which of course, you

387
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,740
would want to sense.

388
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,440
They're objects!

389
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,880
You know, I was playing chess
the other day with my friend

390
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,890
Rick, and I said
to him, you know

391
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:45,520
what I could use more
of is game objects.

392
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,690
I can sense all of
your game objects.

393
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,600
And he didn't get it.

394
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,430
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

395
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,860
PROFESSOR: So Sense
Nearby Game Objects

396
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,900
is an overloaded
function, which means

397
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,930
that you can call it
with multiple arguments.

398
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,880
And that really does help you.

399
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,710
So the point is, this
is a global function,

400
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:10,440
because you can see any game
object if that game object is

401
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,320
of a certain type.

402
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,390
So all of your allied
robots you can see.

403
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,130
Let's go back to our example,
let's say that I am back here,

404
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,460
that's me, over
here at the bottom.

405
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,440
And this guy up
at the top, I can

406
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,280
see where he is back from here.

407
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,690
But my sight range is
actually only here.

408
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,010
So I've got different
detection abilities.

409
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,320
Allied robots, allied
mines, and neutral mines,

410
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,800
are all visible no
matter where you are,

411
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,491
but enemy robots are only
visible within your sight

412
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:49,990
radius.

413
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,260
But it's within any
allied robot site radius.

414
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,930
It's harder to explain
than it is to think about.

415
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,430
In this picture, this
robot can see these guys,

416
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,080
because he's really close.

417
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,010
But this guy can also see them,
because this robot is nearby.

418
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,750
Right, that's pretty
straightforward.

419
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,070
One person was nodding
but he was also yawning,

420
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,760
so he may have been nodding off.

421
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,350
No, I'm only joking.

422
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,760
Yeah, zing!

423
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,860
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

424
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,970
PROFESSOR: Sense
Nearby Game Objects

425
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,410
is a kind of useful
thing to be able to do,

426
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,430
but it's not always
obvious how to use it.

427
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,570
So, later on, I'll
be talking about how

428
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,310
one of the inputs to
this is what type of game

429
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,876
object you want.

430
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,000
I still haven't-- I've been
saying game object over

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,860
and over, but none of you
care about game objects.

432
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,190
You care about
enemy robots, I want

433
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,990
to shoot at the enemy robots.

434
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,080
So you would end up writing,
oh, I want a robot please.

435
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,560
So you tell it, give me game
objects of type Robot.class.

436
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,140
And you would say,
all right, this

437
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,620
is getting kind of confusing.

438
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm feeling a little
bit overwhelmed.

439
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,350
Well don't you worry about it,
because here in the Java Docs,

440
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,650
under package-- and you might
notice that this is the Java

441
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,100
docs version 7,
for Java version 7.

442
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,020
It's real sleek.

443
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,090
We're distributing this
at absolutely no cost.

444
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,590
Yeah.

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,120
Let's see here, oh, look!

446
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,060
It's game object.

447
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,650
There it is.

448
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,150
And oh, look, subinterfaces
include encampments and robots.

449
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,180
Well that's great, that
answers my question.

450
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,910
So now I know that I can put
Robot.class or Encampment.class

451
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,880
and it will give me that
type of game object.

452
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,780
Yeah.

453
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,300
Yeah!

454
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,507
All right.

455
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:49,980
[LAUGHS]

456
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,130
So that's a piece of
centralized information.

457
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,130
Another piece of
centralized info--

458
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,675
so we've talked about
how it's allied robots.

459
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,960
There's allied mines.

460
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,350
I'll talk about the mines and
how you can lay them and defuse

461
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,930
them, and how you get these
things onto the game board.

462
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,430
Allied robots, allied mines.

463
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,980
You've got the radio system,
which is entirely global.

464
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,680
And that means that you can
disrupt somebody else's radio

465
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,590
program.

466
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,150
I have a hunch that there are
several people out there who

467
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,260
would broadcast random numbers
to my favorite channel, 567,

468
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,330
and it would just
totally ruin my player.

469
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,420
I wouldn't be able
to work at all.

470
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,030
Now, in order to limit
this sort of-- there's sort

471
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,510
of a back and forth
between sending messages

472
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,190
that you want to send,
receiving the messages

473
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,250
with a certain amount of,
sort of, redundancy in there,

474
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,010
so you can be safe
against message jamming,

475
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,720
versus actual jamming itself.

476
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,440
How do we assess the balance
of these competing objectives?

477
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,720
Well we've got a cost
associated with everything.

478
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,640
There's no free lunch.

479
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,230
Except dinner for Battlecode.

480
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,400
And that is actually free.

481
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,200
We ordered so much
pizza for today.

482
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,540
Now I'm sure not many of you
ordered that much pizza before.

483
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,720
But let me tell
you that I expected

484
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,820
that-- there's like 120
people here in the room,

485
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,100
and we thought how much
pizza does everybody eat?

486
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,990
Well unfortunately Battlecode
is a male dominated class.

487
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,670
So we'll have slightly
more pizza consumption

488
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,790
than otherwise.

489
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,010
Is that sexist?

490
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,540
And so--

491
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,250
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

492
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,410
PROFESSOR: So we decided
to get 50 pizzas.

493
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,290
And we were like, well
what's awesome pizza?

494
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,920
We like Bertucci's.

495
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,241
You guys don't like Bertucci's.

496
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:48,740
Yeah!

497
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,760
He likes Bertucci's.

498
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,340
Yeah, so that was
like $20 a pizza.

499
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,150
So it was like $1000 for pizza.

to be really good.

Now, I think in the past it's
not been that obvious to me

512
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,240
what the cost of doing a
certain computation is.

513
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,480
Can I jam the enemy?

514
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,350
Is that really going to work, or
am I going to run out of money?

515
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,180
Is a question you could ask.

516
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,800
So here, in the--
let's see here,

517
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,159
I have a place where I
have installed Battlecode.

518
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,700
And you're going to
do something just

519
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,642
like this, where you'll have
that Battlecode-- that's OK,

520
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:43,850
he had to go to the bathroom.

521
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,766
Don't worry about him.

522
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:48,574
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

523
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,490
PROFESSOR: Well it's a
reasonable supposition,

524
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,500
he is human, isn't he?

525
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,630
All right, and so here, in
the Battlecode directory

526
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,550
where I've installed
Battlecode, there's

527
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,800
going to be a text file
that's called method costs.

528
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,890
Bingo.

529
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,700
All right now it
looks disorganized

530
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,090
because everything-- the
strings are different lengths.

531
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,150
But each string represents
a function that you can use.

532
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,530
Like for example attack square.

533
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,029
Or maybe broadcast a message.

534
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,820
Ah, that was the one
we were interested in.

535
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,510
OK, let's look at that.

536
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,151
Broadcast costs 25 bytecodes.

537
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:23,400
All right, let's do a little
bit of math-- arithmetic,

538
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,690
it's not math, is it?

539
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,880
25 bytecodes, all right?

540
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,960
There are 10,000 strings,
which I wrote and erased.

541
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,070
10,000 places to
write a message to.

542
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,210
There are 25 bytecodes
to broadcast a message.

543
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,600
OK, so that means that I
can broadcast 400 messages.

544
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,260
Is that right?

545
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:48,430
Is that this number divided by
that number equals that number?

546
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,090
Is that-- Yeah, yeah.

547
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,275
Yeah, let's go with it.

548
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,790
Yeah, let's go with that.

549
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,670
So you have 400.

550
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,800
No, but maybe you have more of
your robots jamming signals.

551
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,410
OK, how many robots
can you have?

552
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,340
All right, let's do
that computation.

553
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm pretending that I'm you,
and that I'm just like-- OK

554
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,910
I'm not doing a very
good impersonation.

555
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,950
I recognize that.

556
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,980
You'd be much faster at this.

557
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,530
So you would want to find
out how many robots you

558
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,310
can sustain.

559
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,410
Can I get somebody to
suggest one way to figure out

560
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,010
that number?

561
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:28,900
Yes!

562
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,930
You, you, you.

563
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,690
Ah yes you could make a
player and just spawn robots

564
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,280
until they start dying.

565
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,460
Let's say you wanted to
do it in a different way.

566
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,520
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

567
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,130
PROFESSOR: I have
the example here.

568
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,170
What is It?

569
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,550
Game constants, there we are.

570
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,870
So here I'm looking
at the Java docs,

571
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,350
and I can click
on game constants.

572
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm looking at a
different version of it

573
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,340
that didn't actually show the
game constants in the game

574
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,950
constants page.

575
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,820
But that's because we
are well organized.

576
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,420
And this is to show that we're
indomitable, indefatigable,

577
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,810
as it were.

578
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,270
These constant values
indicate, here,

579
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,970
that your headquarters
is capable of producing

580
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,870
quite a few resources.

581
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,730
This shows that it produces
50 resources per turn.

582
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,510
This resource
production enables you

583
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,290
to have an upkeep of robots.

584
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,420
So in the past, we've had
names like flux, and so on.

585
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,500
This year, the name
for it is power.

586
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,760
That's tough though because
we have time as well.

587
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,320
And as you well know power
times time is energy.

588
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,930
And so now we have
energon and energy,

589
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,630
which is a multiple or a
calculated quantity from power.

590
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,270
But don't you worry
too much about it.

591
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,680
It's just a number.

592
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,900
And the usage of this
resource, or power, by robots,

593
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,390
is displayed in unit upkeep.

594
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,066
Which here, is
written incorrectly.

595
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,440
I'm going to be
bring up the most

596
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,820
recent version of this document.

597
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,589
What's nice is that you
guys will get one version,

598
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,630
and then you'll have one
version on your computer

599
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,810
and not, like, 16.

600
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,670
And your one version
will be up to date.

601
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,810
And when you want to
update it, the client

602
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,890
will automatically tell
you that it needs updating.

603
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,080
So you'll just have
the one version,

604
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,800
and you won't have
disaster area.

605
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,040
Yeah, constant value.

606
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,300
So this is the more
recently updated one.

607
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,400
And you can see here the
unit power upkeep is one.

608
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,275
All right, fantastic.

609
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:39,970
We're ready to do a computation.

610
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,110
So I'm going to
put here 40 divided

611
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,975
by-- so this is the
amount of energy,

612
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:48,600
or the amount of
power, that's produced

613
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,080
per turn by your
headquarters divided

614
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,100
by the usage of that power.

615
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,000
Now you're going to say,
all right, I'm bored.

616
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,300
I can do this in my head.

617
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,320
Well maybe you can but some
of us can't, all right?

618
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,120
No, so that would be the number.

619
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,680
But that would say that the
number of robots you get

620
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,790
is independent of how
much work they're doing.

621
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,320
And that doesn't make any sense.

622
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,140
You should get to
have more robots

623
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,730
if you're doing
less computation.

624
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,380
So here you can see,
there is a cost.

625
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,460
Power cost per
bytecode, which is here.

626
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,110
And it's 10 to the minus 4.

627
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:35,650
So let's say that I'm
using-- 10 to the minus 4

628
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,120
times the number bytecodes.

629
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,470
Well, if I'm using zero
byte codes, then I get 40.

630
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,786
Because that would be 1 plus 0.

631
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:46,255
And 40 over one is 40.

632
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:49,080
OK and if I were
using 10,000, which

633
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,170
is also known as 10 to the 4.

634
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,060
Then I would get 20.

635
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,040
Wow, what a big difference.

636
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,040
So that tells you that if
you want to go ahead and spam

637
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,060
the message system--
let's say you're spamming,

638
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,090
so you're using all of
your bytecodes possible,

639
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,760
and you have 20 robots.

640
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,270
So 20 robots are spamming 400
message integers per turn.

641
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,620
So you're doing nothing
but spamming the messages.

642
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:24,630
And you're getting eight,
zero, zero, ze-- Oh, ahh, ahh.

643
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,430
Oh, it's not even enough.

644
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,040
It's not enough.

645
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,080
Well, so that shows that
you could jam the enemy.

646
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,100
And maybe you should, if you've
got nothing better to do,

647
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,520
if you derive a personal
satisfaction from it.

648
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,690
But this is worth saying.

649
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,090
These kinds of calculations
are important for strategy.

650
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,890
But don't make them
totally fixed in stone.

651
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,600
Because we change
the game, we tweak

652
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,130
it a little bit for balance.

653
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,070
So if it ends up being that
10,000 is just so much radio

654
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,570
space that we just would
rather not have it,

655
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,590
then it could just get
knocked down to 1000.

656
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,240
And then all of a sudden
your player, which

657
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,010
depends on this or that
messaging construct,

658
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,370
may have to be
somewhat rethought.

659
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,620
So this is a good time to
talk about the organization

660
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,720
of the competition.

661
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,830
Is it?

662
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,870
I think it is.

663
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,011
Let's go to the
Battlecode website.

664
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:24,260
And let me show you something.

665
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,051
I don't know I knew
that you could do this.

666
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:29,770
But previous years
we've had like a list.

667
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,990
And it'll be in
text form, and it'll

668
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,830
say on this date we have this
competition, and this one.

669
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,090
And then you have to
open up a window of this.

670
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,900
And then every single
one of you opens up

671
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,210
another window with
Gmail or Google Calendar.

672
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,510
And then you like manually enter
in the-- do you not do that?

673
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,390
Who has to do that whenever
you have a competition,

674
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,830
you want to know
when things are?

675
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,670
Yeah, yeah there's
like two people who

676
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,140
also have to do that.

677
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,160
So I figured, in light of saving
those two people some effort,

678
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,490
we made this Google Calendar.

679
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,900
And you could see, here's
today's classroom session,

680
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,690
here in 1-190 from
5:00 to 6:00 PM.

681
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,510
And it's got the
lab written there.

682
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,380
So the specs and software are
released, as of 37 minutes ago,

683
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,886
roughly speaking.

684
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:17,260
And what we'll
do, after this, is

685
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,700
we'll talk about
how to set it up.

686
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,800
So there you go, specs
and software are released.

687
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,000
The sprint tournament
is on the 14th.

688
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,150
And what that means is you
can submit a player for that,

689
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:32,170
and you can be entered for a
relatively small prize pool.

690
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,810
Relatively small,
the actual prize

691
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,450
pool for the finals
is I think $50,000.

692
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,487
So relatively small
is just some fraction

693
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:40,070
of that which is
still non-negligible.

694
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,420
Anyway, so that's going to be
really exciting because that

695
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,620
will give you the opportunity
to test your code out

696
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,770
to see what other players
are doing, because to

697
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,460
some extent winning
is going to be

698
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,980
related to what other people do.

699
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,570
But more importantly,
having fun is

700
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,417
related to what other
people do, and talking

701
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,250
to the other people.

702
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,000
Like this social utopia of
mine, the idea of this lab,

703
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,660
is totally new-- as well
as the Google Calendar

704
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,140
--to try to make things more
easy and fun and together,

705
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,520
among us as Battlecoders.

706
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,840
Because we do all
share that common link.

707
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,450
Yes.

708
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,590
So the point is
that if you didn't

709
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,170
know you could do
this, what you do

710
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:26,750
is you go to-- if you want to
add this to your own calendar,

711
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,600
there's like a button where
you can go and do that.

712
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,490
I think the button isn't
available because-- Yeah,

713
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,242
there.

714
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:35,357
There?

715
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:35,940
At the bottom.

716
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,870
At the bottom?

717
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,784
Yeah, there you go.

718
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:39,200
And then you just
add it right in,

719
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,110
so I've already got it here,
in my personal calendar.

720
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,100
And there you go, so
you can see that I'm

721
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,870
having lunch on the 24th.

722
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,050
And OK, so you get the idea.

723
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,710
So the sprint tournament
is-- the submission deadline,

724
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,210
you can see here,
is on the 14th.

725
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,087
On the 16th, on that
Wednesday, in class,

726
00:32:57,087 --> 00:32:59,420
we'll show some of the games
from the sprint tournament.

727
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,961
I don't think we'll
show all of them.

728
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:03,800
See because what used to happen,
is we would show all the games.

729
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,120
And there's like 100 teams.

730
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,130
And that ends up being
a relatively large size

731
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,280
round-robin bracket with, I
think, double elimination.

732
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,400
So it's a ton of games.

733
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,250
I think it generally
takes like five hours.

734
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,630
But it ends up bumping up to
six, seven, or eight hours

735
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,230
because we end up
showing up there,

736
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,130
and the tournament code that
sets it all up doesn't work.

737
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,536
And so it takes forever.

738
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,910
So we're going to
do this year is

739
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,360
we'll just sort to
distill it down,

740
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,818
we'll have something
simple to show

741
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:32,570
that's fantastic and
exciting on the Wednesday.

742
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,950
And in the future, when we
have our later-- our seating

743
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,696
tournament, which is sort
of the same kind of thing,

744
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:41,320
but it's more important, because
it determines your positioning

745
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,500
for the final tournament.

746
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,724
When we have this
seating tournament,

747
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:46,640
we're going to live
stream it on the internet,

748
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,306
so that you don't
even have to-- I mean,

749
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:51,260
you guys all trekked out
here in the dead of night

750
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,930
and 5:00 or 6:00 PM
in the freezing cold.

751
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,040
I mean there could be people out
there dying because they tried

752
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,270
to make it here and
they didn't make it.

753
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,700
That would be horrible, that's
not something to laugh at.

754
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,150
So you came all
the way out here,

755
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,659
but we don't want to make you
have to do that much work.

756
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,070
Because we want you to have fun.

757
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,736
So there you go.

758
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,761
We've got a calendar to
save you that effort.

759
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,969
We have lab sessions to save
you the effort of trying

760
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,270
to make friends, and
we'll have live streams

761
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,909
in the future, which will
make that much better.

762
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,580
So as you can see here, it
says the seating tournament

763
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,710
submission deadline
is on the 21st.

764
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,800
And the seating tournament
will be on the 22nd.

765
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,719
So what that does, is it gets
you your position in the finals

766
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,554
tournament.

767
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:39,720
The finals submission
deadline is different, though.

768
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,830
So you can continually
update your player.

769
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,440
My point is that you
only have three weeks.

770
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,900
It's the 7th today.

771
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,190
And the finals submission
deadline is the 28th.

772
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,340
You have three weeks to
make an amazing player.

773
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,170
And each week, you'll
have the chance

774
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,489
to-- you could upload
your player at any time,

775
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,730
you can do scrimmage matches
with other players at any time.

776
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,980
And then finally, you'll be
able to submit to the finals.

777
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,400
I mean, I don't think it's
worth getting too hyped up

778
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,029
about this final thing because
after all, in my experience,

779
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:13,570
game changes at the last minute
screw you over at the finals,

780
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,630
and ends up being a crap shoot.

781
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,610
No, no, I exaggerate.

782
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,220
But the point is, the fun
should be had as you go.

783
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,930
And I am here to help with that.

784
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,660
So what you need--
so just one more

785
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,680
thing about this
administration is

786
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,350
that I think that it's required
that you upload a resume,

787
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,892
and that you be an MIT student
if you want to earn-- no,

788
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:41,600
that's not right.

789
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,440
We have international
competitors, this year.

790
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,790
We have sort of a thing going on
with the University of Sussex.

791
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,659
If you have friends
at other universities,

792
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,950
they can feel free to join you.

793
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,880
And they don't have
to be MIT students

794
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,010
to either play or win money.

795
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:00,630
And if they're in
Honolulu, or Alaska,

796
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,350
we'll fly them in
here for the finals

797
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,900
because we expect the finalists
to show up at this dinner

798
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,110
that we have at the Hyatt.

799
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,980
We have this fantastically
lavish dinner.

800
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,587
I think we paid
like $5,000 for it.

801
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:19,170
Aaron, could you
come up here and show

802
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,350
what the sponsors
are by just turning

803
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,890
your back to the audience?

804
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,125
No, actually there's a
button here, I can do that.

805
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

806
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good point.

807
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,740
OK, so here are our sponsors.

808
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,350
We have these fancy company
reps show up at this dinner.

809
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,050
So if you're among
the finalists,

810
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,740
then you show up at
the fancy reps dinner

811
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,700
and they offer you
jobs and stuff.

812
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,240
It's apparently very
nice, I've never been.

813
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,660
AUDIENCE: [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

814
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,370
Yeah, that's because I was busy.

815
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,410
Yeah, that's why.

816
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,190
Yeah, that's why.

817
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,700
That's why.

818
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,730
No.

819
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,810
So these are some
of the sponsors.

820
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,009
Our main sponsors
and some other ones.

821
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:56,550
And you'll get a chance to meet
them, as well, at the finals.

822
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,300
So you don't have to be the best
of the best by whatever stupid

823
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,600
metric we come up with.

824
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,730
What you have to
be is-- anybody who

825
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,380
does Battlecode is an attractive
person to these employers who

826
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,900
will meet you and give
you business cards.

827
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,080
And it'll be a good
time for everyone.

828
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,890
And so in that note
you have, once again,

829
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:23,630
on the calendar page, the finals
are on the 2nd of February.

830
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,300
So that'll be when that
happens and it'll be in 26-100.

831
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,680
It'll be a blast, and you
should be looking forward

832
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,780
to that very much.

833
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,980
I feel like I've
just been droning on,

834
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,620
ranting about what I don't
like about StarCraft.

835
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,850
And I haven't talked enough
about the things that

836
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,800
are related to
gameplay this year.

837
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,115
This year, you
have these robots.

838
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:53,140
It's astounding to me, that I--
Oh, is that why it didn't work?

839
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,300
Because I was using this
one instead of this one,

840
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,650
and I meant to use
this main client?

841
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,260
Yeah, that's the one.

842
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,990
OK, yeah.

843
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,710
This was the point I was
trying to make earlier.

844
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,250
Where I was going to
take compute time bot,

845
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,320
playing against compute
time bot, on this map.

846
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,710
This is sort of how
to do it, but it'll

847
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,580
be done a little
bit differently.

848
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,550
And so the goal here is to see
how many robots can be built.

849
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,110
But this guy-- Ah!

850
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,830
I think team A and
B got switched.

851
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,780
So what I'll do is I'll just
briefly switch around the code.

852
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,470
So this is sort of the
structure of a robot controller.

853
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:40,210
What happens is this code is
run on each robot on your team,

854
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,810
and that's what plays the game.

855
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,900
I'm sure most of you
know that already.

856
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,630
And so what I'll do is I'll
just check that the team is B.

857
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,340
So I can switch the team,
hit Save, run it again.

858
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,840
Well it doesn't
work as well as I

859
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,548
was expecting because
these guys are just

860
00:38:57,548 --> 00:39:00,500
dying when they go
through the minefield.

861
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,430
That's interesting.

862
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,100
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

863
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,310
PROFESSOR: You know, you can
make your own maps in this.

864
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,580
This is a really good
example of debugging.

865
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,355
And you can say that
I did this on purpose.

866
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:13,480
Although if you have a
strict adherence to honesty,

867
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,790
you might not.

868
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,050
So the maps are located where?

869
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,870
You're looking at what, here?

870
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,790
So you'll have a directory
where you can see your maps.

871
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,990
And you'll be also
able to see them here.

872
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,110
So here's simple.

873
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,380
And what if I want
to edit this map.

874
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,460
Can I do that?

875
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,220
Can I just double click it?

876
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,370
It's an XML document.

877
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,330
Oh, look.

878
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,780
Is it?

879
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,290
Oh, data, OK.

880
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,830
Here's some data.

881
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,552
I'm beginning to get
to the part-- see,

882
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:46,260
this would be really
easy if I could just

883
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,167
do edit with notepad.

884
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:49,500
AUDIENCE: --source at the bottom

885
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,770
PROFESSOR: Source!

886
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,640
No.

887
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

888
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,502
PROFESSOR: Tab.

889
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:57,624
AUDIENCE: No, down.

890
00:39:57,624 --> 00:39:58,290
PROFESSOR: Down?

891
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:58,789
Down.

892
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:00,550
AUDIENCE: Where design is.

893
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,180
PROFESSOR: Oh!

894
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,984
Bingo.

895
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:02,484
All right!

896
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,720
Yeah, thank you.

897
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,800
So then, you can
see that I can make

898
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,100
my own maps using these codes.

899
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,750
So the character "3"
indicates a neutral mine.

900
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,600
So I can just do like a find
replace, were I'll replace "3"

901
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,610
with ".", which is
an open terrain.

902
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,307
I'll just do replace all.

903
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:18,890
And then I'll just
make sure to change

904
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,374
this one or else the
whole map would be mines.

905
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:24,540
I'm sure two of you thought
that I wouldn't do that,

906
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,660
but I assure you that I'm
operating at full capacity.

907
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,320
All right, so this is an
example where you can see I've

908
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,720
just built bunch of robots.

909
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,830
And you can see that
this is my power.

910
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,690
Your power stored
in a reserve bank.

911
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,422
And what I'm going to do
is suddenly at round 1,000,

912
00:40:42,422 --> 00:40:43,880
I'm going to start
computing a lot.

913
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,546
So right now you can
see that this robot

914
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:47,250
is using 38 bytecodes.

915
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,990
Not very many.

916
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,940
If you're amazing
at counting you'll

917
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,390
see that there
are about 40 here.

918
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,630
And the new robots-- oh, boom!

919
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,730
Look at that.

920
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,320
The new robots died because they
don't have enough-- these guys

921
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,710
don't have enough compute-- they
don't have enough power to run.

922
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,390
So they lose hit points
until they're dead.

923
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,850
And then if they all
start using code,

924
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,240
boom, when we cut down
to half the number.

925
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,080
And so you could
see quite visually

926
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,360
the effect of using 10,000
bytecodes versus using

927
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,280
no bytecodes at all.

928
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,160
So from here, down to there.

929
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,910
Bang.

930
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:31,580
This power quantity can be
affected by various things.

931
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,430
So there are some equations that
I could show for what that is.

932
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,590
But maybe I've just gone
a bit far field here

933
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,580
because I've been talking
about some details.

934
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,010
Here's the general
overview, right?

935
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,800
You don't really need too
many of the specifics,

936
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,257
because all you've got
to do is find the enemy.

937
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,840
And there's a function
that does that.

938
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,590
Oh, look at that, I'll just
add that to the global list.

939
00:41:53,590 --> 00:42:00,820
There's, "Sense Enemy
Headquarters," bingo.

940
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,760
Done.

941
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,530
If you were interested in
a little bit of masochism,

942
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,190
coding masochism, and just
doing something the hard way,

943
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,960
you could do that.

944
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,120
Because what we've
also provided,

945
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,070
is the dimensions
of the map, and you

946
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,800
know that the upper left
corner of the map is 0,0.

947
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,985
So with a symmetry
operation you could say,

948
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:18,650
my headquarters is here.

949
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,970
The map size is this.

950
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,400
My location is here.

951
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,020
Therefore, the enemy must
be at this other location.

952
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,772
So more than one way to skin
a cat, as the case may be.

953
00:42:27,772 --> 00:42:29,730
So you locate the enemy,
and all you have to do

954
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,710
is walk up to him.

955
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,070
Because this year attacking
happens automatically

956
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,080
for soldiers.

957
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,270
So right now there isn't
any fighting going on.

958
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,660
But I'll show an
example that will

959
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,500
show that all they've got to
do is go near one another,

960
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,450
and then their attack
power is distributed

961
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,680
among all of the
robots they can see.

962
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,460
So this is some old
code that we were

963
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,570
writing when we were
testing the game.

964
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,230
And what you'll
find is that when

965
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,370
robots come close
to one another,

966
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,334
they make these circles that
indicate their attack range.

967
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,750
So they're attacking-- this
guy is distributing his attack

968
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,620
among this one and that one.

969
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,910
Similarly, this one is
distributing among these three.

970
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,720
So his attack power in
this version of the game

971
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,560
was different.

972
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,450
But right now I believe
the attack power is six.

973
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,700
So he would be dealing two
damage to each of these.

974
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,150
What you also see in
this picture, which

975
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,270
I believe is quite instructive,
is the shield robots.

976
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:40,110
Yeah, any robot that's standing
next to this shields robot

977
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,900
will be given this
additional shields parameter.

978
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,347
And so you can see it here
in the user interface.

979
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:46,930
There's a green bar
indicating health,

980
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,940
and a blue bar
indicating shields.

981
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,050
In the latest implementation
of Battlecode,

982
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,150
shields serve as
a protection only

983
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,500
against a certain type of
encampment that can be built.

984
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,700
So is these encampments
work in the following way.

985
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,680
You start with just
a headquarters,

986
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,150
and that produces
these soldiers.

987
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,470
So you can produce a soldier
at any tile around you,

988
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,190
if that tile is unoccupied.

989
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,770
That soldier can then be used
to construct an encampment.

990
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,840
And he can construct any of a
number of types of encampment.

991
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,260
So I've made this nice, handy,
useful Battlecode data sheet.

992
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,770
People from last
year might remember

993
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,720
that I made sort of a handy
unit sheet at that time.

994
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,990
But this year it's 100% more
accurate than last year's.

995
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,480
That's right.

996
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,040
We've checked and
double checked,

997
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,650
but this is the latest version.

998
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,400
So you can see here all of
the different types of units.

999
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,520
And there's a Boolean for
whether it is an encampment,

1000
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,990
in terms of just a description.

1001
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,865
Although, you know, that's kind
of not a fantastic description.

1002
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,170
Because all of these
units-- you know,

1003
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,040
because we like to
be straightforward.

1004
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,660
It's a realistic
preparation for your life

1005
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,090
as a professional coder, that
the database and documentation

1006
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,960
you receive will contain
information opposite to the way

1007
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,412
that things are run.

1008
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:13,870
So you can see here that they're
all listed-- some of these

1009
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,300
are listed as encampments.

1010
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,540
But in fact they are all robots.

1011
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,830
Yes, I believe that's correct.

1012
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,460
They are all robots.

1013
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,310
So the headquarters is
what you start with.

1014
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:31,110
It generates 40 power turn, and
it can spawn these soldiers.

1015
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,579
It takes 10 turns
to spawn a soldier.

1016
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:36,120
Or it can research upgrades,
and I'll talk about the upgrades

1017
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,560
below, in just a minute.

1018
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,510
The soldier has an upkeep
of 1 to 2 power per turn,

1019
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,240
depending on byte code usage.

1020
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,280
It automatically
distributes its attack power

1021
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,830
among adjacent enemy units.

1022
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,220
And it has the
capability of laying

1023
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,410
mines, which take 25
turns to lay a mine.

1024
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,380
Defusing mines, which take
5 turns, and capturing

1025
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,797
encampments, which
takes 50 turns.

1026
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,255
Now you might ask,
all right, where

1027
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:01,430
am I getting these numbers?

1028
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,400
I'm assembling this
sort of convenient

1029
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,050
diagram but what if
the specs change?

1030
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,675
You know, where do
I get these numbers?

1031
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:09,740
Well they're all under game
constants under robot type

1032
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,730
enum, or the upgrade
enum, and you'll

1033
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,470
find them all the Java docs.

1034
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,250
Alternatively, you
could all always

1035
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,080
ask us where they are by
going on our IRC chat,

1036
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,780
or talking to one
of us in person.

1037
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,620
So you can see here they're
laying mines, defusing mines,

1038
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,950
capturing encampments.

1039
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,340
And in the act of capturing
one of these encampments, which

1040
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,870
is a pre-existing location on
the map, these black circles.

1041
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,600
In the act of capturing
one of those--

1042
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,970
there's nothing
magical about it.

1043
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,020
Because here, among the
robot controller methods,

1044
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,690
you'll find capture encampment.

1045
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,900
And what you'll do is
you'll specify what type

1046
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,600
of enchantment
you want it to be.

1047
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,459
And you might ask,
what types are there?

1048
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,250
Well, you could either
look at handy chart,

1049
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,430
or you could click
here, under robot type.

1050
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,130
And this enum robot type
will show you the types

1051
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,590
that you can build.

1052
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,000
You can build artillery,
generator, medbay, shields,

1053
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,130
and supplier.

1054
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,990
The headquarters and
soldier are different.

1055
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,224
They're not built
from encampments.

1056
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:11,640
I don't know if that's written
anywhere, but I've said it,

1057
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,720
so now you know it.

1058
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,490
Yeah.

1059
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,020
So that's how you're going to be
able to build these units, that

1060
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,800
are shown here.

1061
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,460
So the medbay heals adjacent
robots, 2 hit points per turn.

1062
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,240
You can see that's their quote,
"attack power," because attack

1063
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,840
is a lot like healing.

1064
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,560
You know, modern surgery,
you can use scalpel and such.

1065
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,359
These are also
considered weapons.

1066
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,400
I'm sure you couldn't
bring a scalpel on a plane.

1067
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,150
So attack is a really good word
for healing-- a healing unit.

1068
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:49,398
And if you don't believe me talk
to any medicine man you know.

1069
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:53,530
Shields will give
all adjacent robots

1070
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,880
5 shield points per turn.

1071
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,930
So if you cluster 8
units around them,

1072
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,090
then that'll go ahead and give
40 shield points distributed

1073
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,820
among them, to the extent
that 5 times 8 is 40.

1074
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,170
The shields only protect
you from artillery, though.

1075
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,920
They don't protect you
against other soldiers.

1076
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,540
Now, these robots
that are shielded

1077
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,810
will lose 1 shield point
per turn, as it wears off.

1078
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,610
But there's no cap on the
amount of shields they can have.

1079
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,847
So they can have, I think,
10 to the 8th shields.

1080
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:26,305
Which is like a lot more than
their total hit points of 40.

1081
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:29,350
Right?

1082
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:33,090
So that's effectively infinite.

1083
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:37,610
The artillery is the one unit
that can shoot at a far range.

1084
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,740
It could shoot at a range of 63.

1085
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,680
Now we always talk
about squared ranges,

1086
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,950
because that makes it
easier to do comparisons

1087
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,610
without having to
take a square root.

1088
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,590
Although I guess if we
did give you ranges,

1089
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,690
and not squared ranges, you
could just square it and then

1090
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,898
compare it to the range that
you had just calculated.

1091
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,670
this way works really well.

1092
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,210
So what I can do is I can
demonstrate for you what that

1093
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,100
looks like by opening
up-- oh my goodness,

1094
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,250
I'm almost out of time.

1095
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,810
I can open up this stockpiling--
no, that's not right.

1096
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:16,980
I made it in the map
maker program, down here.

1097
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,700
Yeah, so this shows
you what 63 looks like.

1098
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,957
So if you're here in the middle,
you can see all of these tiles

1099
00:49:24,957 --> 00:49:26,415
but you can't see
the ones outside.

1100
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,500
But its site range is only 14.

1101
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,220
Every robot has a site range
of 14, As you can see here,

1102
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,970
in this document.

1103
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,180
So the attack range is
63, the site range is 14.

1104
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,670
So, this is one of
those cases where

1105
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:48,480
you'd need scouting units that
would know what to shoot at.

1106
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,510
And it's really helpful that you
have this global information.

1107
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,340
Because you don't
need to post to radio

1108
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,760
to tell the artillery
what to shoot at.

1109
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,210
Because he can already
see all of the unit

1110
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,750
that your allies can see.

1111
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,990
He can't necessarily
see the enemies,

1112
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,510
unless your guys are nearby.

1113
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,590
So, yes, the artillery does
40 damage to the target

1114
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,690
that it specifies, and 20
splash damage to adjacent tiles.

1115
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,240
And that does include
friendly fire,

1116
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,420
so you've got to be careful
about where you shoot.

1117
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,230
The generator generates
10 resources per turn.

1118
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,460
And that resource is power.

1119
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,790
So that's added on to
your headquarter power.

1120
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,390
So if you build a
bunch of generators,

1121
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,250
you can support more soldiers.

1122
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,010
And finally, the
supplier will reduce

1123
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,350
the build time for
soldiers by 5%.

1124
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:35,820
And that's multiplicative.

1125
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,680
So if you have two
suppliers, then it's

1126
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:45,470
0.95 squared times 10 turns.

1127
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,830
This year, we give
you the opportunity

1128
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,180
of building upgrades as
well, researching upgrades

1129
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,800
at your headquarters.

1130
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,170
So your headquarters
is your central unit,

1131
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:58,020
the goal is to defeat
the enemy headquarters.

1132
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,560
To do that, you could just
walk your robots on over

1133
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,600
and kill them dead.

1134
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,380
It's not required that
you research upgrades

1135
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,520
and built encampments.

1136
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,936
And that's one of
the ways that we

1137
00:51:07,936 --> 00:51:10,480
make the competition
somewhat easier to enter,

1138
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,310
easier to get
something that works.

1139
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,220
But if you want to
research upgrades,

1140
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,440
to make a strategy
that's tailored

1141
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,240
around a certain approach,
then you can get these.

1142
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,320
The future upgrade
reduces your energy decay

1143
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,860
because the way
that you hold power,

1144
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,060
is that you can't just
mass it up indefinitely.

1145
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,190
You get a power income
from your headquarters,

1146
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,590
and you spend power to
upkeep your soldiers.

1147
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,140
But we don't want that--
if you have no soldiers

1148
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,030
and you're just
getting income, we

1149
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,790
don't want that to
go up indefinitely.

1150
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,010
So every turn that
gets multiplied

1151
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,260
by a number that reduces it.

1152
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,510
So the energy decay,
or the loss is 20%.

1153
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,520
But if you research fusion,
the loss is only 1%.

1154
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,680
So then you might think
of stockpiling energy

1155
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,740
and then spending it all
at once to get a larger

1156
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,150
burst of robots, which couldn't
be sustained for a long time.

1157
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,530
But then again, you only
have to win one second.

1158
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,240
Finally, the-- OK, so then
there's more upgrades.

1159
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,320
Vision upgrade extends your
squared vision from 10 to 32.

1160
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,050
This should say 14, but
as you know everything

1161
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,960
is always up to date
100 percent of the time.

1162
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,490
So here's a demonstration of
what that would look like.

1163
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,380
Here's 10 and here's 32.

1164
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,570
Boom, what a big difference.

1165
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,110
That's quite a lot more vision.

1166
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,770
That's important because
you can defuse any mine

1167
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,160
within your site range if you
have the diffusion ability.

1168
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,290
Which is not to be confused
with chemical diffusion, which

1169
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,810
is something else.

1170
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,590
Yes, this is for
defusing things,

1171
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,512
and it is spelled correctly.

1172
00:52:45,512 --> 00:52:48,484
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

1173
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:50,900
PROFESSOR: So yeah, that extends
your mine defusing range.

1174
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,820
That's pretty important,
but keep in mind

1175
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,420
that you can still only
defuse one at a time.

1176
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,729
So you have to select which
one you're going to defuse.

1177
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:01,770
And then you defuse that.

1178
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,640
Now, it's important
to note that you

1179
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,780
can see where-- I've said that
you see your allied mines.

1180
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:12,130
I haven't said that you can
see your neutral mines as well.

1181
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,680
But you don't see enemy mines
until one of your robots

1182
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,350
has stepped on it.

1183
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:21,990
So that means that you can't--
I don't think you can defuse

1184
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,520
something you can't see.

1185
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,630
But actually I don't know,
I'll have to check with that.

1186
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,420
Because it may be that
you could just spam

1187
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,620
defuse on terrain
that you don't know.

1188
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,370
And that might actually defuse
things that you can't see.

1189
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:39,930
At the same time, that's
not a fantastic strategy,

1190
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,870
because defused takes 5 turns.

1191
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,410
And during those 5
turns you cannot attack.

1192
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:47,440
So that leaves you--
or can you attack?

1193
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,875
I'm thinking maybe
you can attack.

1194
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:49,666
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

1195
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,165
PROFESSOR: You know what, you
can't-- it's a very vulnerable

1196
00:53:52,165 --> 00:53:54,260
position, to be
defusing something.

1197
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,231
Because you're concentrating
on something else.

1198
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:57,980
How do you going to
perform as effectively

1199
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,280
on a different task?

1200
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,950
Pickaxe is the tool
that you really

1201
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,050
need if you want to
lay a ton of mines.

1202
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,760
Because instead of laying just
one mine, where your robot is--

1203
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,354
I guess I'm going
to have to come up

1204
00:54:09,354 --> 00:54:11,314
with a system for
describing robot--

1205
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,480
that's sort of like a robot.

1206
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,630
Maybe it's a Chinese character.

1207
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,240
So that's a robot,
and ordinarily he

1208
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,740
would lay a mine here,
but if you have pickaxe,

1209
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,300
he will lay mines in
all of these positions

1210
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,110
for the same cost of
laying just one mine.

1211
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,250
Pretty useful to have.

1212
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,130
And it takes the same amount.

1213
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,090
So laying a mine cost
25 rounds, defusing

1214
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,219
a mine costs five rounds.

1215
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:36,260
So you could do the math.

1216
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,210
If you have pickaxe,
you could lay them

1217
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,530
as fast as the other
team can defuse them,

1218
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:44,210
provided you can get into an
open space where you can do it.

1219
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,040
Realistically they might be
able to encroach, and get you

1220
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,630
during that time.

1221
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,160
And why do you
want to lay mines?

1222
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,950
Doesn't that slow the game down?

1223
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,800
Doesn't that mean
that things will just

1224
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,640
move to slowly, make it
a boring thing to watch?

1225
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,270
I would say no, because
during that time

1226
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,190
you could be researching
the nuclear missile.

1227
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,500
That's right.

1228
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,200
That's right, we
knew that it would

1229
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,830
be interesting to watch
players build nuclear missiles.

1230
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,670
If you research that,
you win immediately.

1231
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,540
So--

1232
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,400
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

1233
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,000
That's yet another
fun way to win,

1234
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,950
and I'm going to show you an
example of somebody attempting

1235
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,020
to win that way.

1236
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,380
This will only take as
much time as it took me

1237
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,510
the last time I tried to do it.

1238
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,360
It's under-- golly, you won't
have nearly-- oh, it's right

1239
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,380
here.

1240
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,960
It must be so hard to watch
me, because it's like, oh man,

1241
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,830
he's looking right at it.

1242
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,580
Let's see, so let's
put do nothing bot--

1243
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,980
because that's a decent
match for the nuke bot.

1244
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,680
Where is he?

1245
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,305
Is he not here?

1246
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,390
AUDIENCE: No, he's
in the middle.

1247
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,050
PROFESSOR: He's in the middle.

1248
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,258
Oh, I'm looking right at him.

1249
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:53,010
All right.

1250
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:57,080
All right, well it's by no
means a foregone conclusion

1251
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,070
who wins this match.

1252
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,910
This is an old version
of the code where

1253
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:05,670
nuking took 1,000 turns
instead of 400 turns.

1254
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,670
But that's not to say that
the red team will necessarily

1255
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,120
win on turn 1,000.

1256
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,150
Oh wait.

1257
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,130
It could only take 400
turns wait a minute.

1258
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,550
Oh, that's 1,000 and
this was-- OK yeah, hey!

1259
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:17,650
It happened.

1260
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,860
There you go.

1261
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,260
So yeah, the nuclear
missile has-- I mean,

1262
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,986
it's not a very
impressive graphic.

1263
00:56:23,986 --> 00:56:27,904
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

1264
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:29,570
PROFESSOR: It's
technically the same one

1265
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,370
we use for every
other explosion.

1266
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,710
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

1267
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:37,710
PROFESSOR: But I think what
we'll do is for the finals,

1268
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,510
we've got a new
match visualizer.

1269
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,160
So this was an old
version of the code,

1270
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,618
because of course I wouldn't
show you something up to date.

1271
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,935
That would be that help
you instead of hinder you.

1272
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:49,490
And what we're trying to do
is train you to be amazing.

1273
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,961
And it's working, I swear.

1274
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:54,210
So what I'll do is I'll show
this version of it, which

1275
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,327
is great, because it shows
the thing researching.

1276
00:56:56,327 --> 00:56:58,160
All right, well later
versions of the client

1277
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,535
that you're going
to receive will

1278
00:56:59,535 --> 00:57:02,360
show what things are researching
in the client window.

1279
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,914
And I think it really would
not be in an excessive--

1280
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,580
the pizza should be
arriving any moment,

1281
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,413
so I know that the
gurgling of your stomachs

1282
00:57:09,413 --> 00:57:14,780
is totally reasonable and
will be resolved imminently.

1283
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,610
If I run this version,
then I think-- let's see,

1284
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,574
is there-- so let's put do
nothing against the nuke guy.

1285
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:22,740
Is the nuke guy still there?

1286
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,060
He is, OK.

1287
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,360
So this version of
the map viewer shows

1288
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,830
researches that are going on.

1289
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:28,330
Yeah.

1290
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,870
And you can see he's researching
pickaxe, diffusion, sight

1291
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,770
range, the fusion
thing that reduces

1292
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:35,960
the amount of energy loss.

1293
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,710
He's researching everything.

1294
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,870
And whereas the other do
nothing guy-- you know,

1295
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,740
you could describe
him as a pacifist.

1296
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:48,820
The philosophy that
he is developing,

1297
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,220
using three bytecodes per
round, may change the world.

1298
00:57:53,220 --> 00:58:00,290
So I see no reason to hate
on his choice of vocation.

1299
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,820
I would definitely not--
yeah, no, definitely.

1300
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,340
OK.

1301
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,800
So you can see here that
nuke is researching.

1302
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,540
So in a tournament
scenario we could all

1303
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,252
start getting excited
and going ohhhhh!

1304
00:58:11,252 --> 00:58:12,210
What's going to happen?

1305
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,510
Is it going to be close?

1306
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,957
And that sort of thing.

1307
00:58:14,957 --> 00:58:16,540
I mean of course at
the end it's going

1308
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,290
to be a bit of an
anti-climax because it's

1309
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,390
going to show a
little puff ball,

1310
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:23,640
like somebody made
popcorn on one tile.

1311
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,020
But we'll be able to overcome
that because we can just

1312
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,115
switch to YouTube
and show a clip

1313
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:33,640
of some giant nuclear test.

1314
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,020
All right, that's all
I have for you now.

1315
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,850
I mean to say that
we're going to show

1316
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,130
you a whole bunch of things.

1317
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,680
You can get up and go,
I know a lot of you

1318
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,460
have appointments with very
attractive young women and men.

1319
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,700
And that's totally OK.

1320
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:52,760
But I recommend that you
stick around, eat some pizza,

1321
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,770
hear about how to
set up Battlecode.

1322
00:58:54,770 --> 00:59:02,030
And know that we will have
our developer testing code up.

1323
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:05,550
The team name, here on
the Battlecode website.

1324
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,900
You can see here, team list.

1325
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,164
We just made a team that you can
use to test your code against.

1326
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:13,455
That's down here at the bottom.

1327
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,850
It's test, somewhere.

1328
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,300
Yeah, Teh Devs
Test, there you go.

1329
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,307
Did you guys make this many
teams in the last 2 seconds?

1330
00:59:26,307 --> 00:59:26,890
You must have.

1331
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,110
You know, it's
important to multitask.

1332
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:32,490
Yeah, so you can
upload your player

1333
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,860
and test it against
Teh Devs test player.

1334
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,460
And that'll be
available all the time,

1335
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,060
and that's probably
sort of your first step

1336
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,060
on your road to success.

1337
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,370
Thank you very much for coming,
and if you have any questions

1338
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:49,110
you can come to us after.

1339
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,660
[APPLAUSE]
