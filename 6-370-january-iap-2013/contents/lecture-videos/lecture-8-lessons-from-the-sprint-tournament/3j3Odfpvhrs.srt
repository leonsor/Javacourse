8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,610
PROFESSOR: Alright,
and with that,

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,510
I think we'll be ready to
start on lecture seven.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,350
Not really a lecture,
we're just talking

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,130
about lessons from
the Sprint Tournament.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,440
And you could whine and
complain about the map set

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,380
and I would totally support you.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,067
Because that map set was crazy.

15
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,650
So, I'm just going
to have a seat here

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,020
and I'll bring up this little
Word document that I've got.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,780
Where we're going to talk
about a few aspects of maps,

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,840
a few aspects of teams.

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,600
So let's zoom right on in.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,330
So, map dependent stuff,
which is written here.

21
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,510
So, we saw a bunch of stuff that
really killed a bunch of teams.

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,550
We had mines in
the way of spawn.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,500
Make sure you check
that you don't

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,020
try to spawn a unit
on top of a mine.

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,460
That's another thing, if a
unit is on top of a mine,

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,210
for whatever reason, he
should probably try to move.

27
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,030
In previous years,
we've had spawn delays,

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,580
so that when a
unit is spawned it

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,330
can't move for a certain
number of rounds.

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,520
But not this year, he
can move immediately.

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,750
So if you're on top of a mine,
and you have a hit point number

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,030
x, and the defuse time is
y, and the number of rounds

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,644
it would take to kill you
with the mine doing damage z,

34
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,060
you would just do
the math and see

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,160
whether it's worthwhile
to try to defuse it.

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,980
Because you can't
have multiple units

37
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,480
defuse the mine on
different rounds.

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
It doesn't continue
defusion progress.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,740
So anyway, they'll just die.

40
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,240
And we saw some
real hero mines that

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,590
have been promoted
to Supreme Commander

42
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,440
and they're now commanding
fleets in the Pacific.

43
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,940
Another thing was encampments.

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,510
So, sometimes the encampments
block off other things.

45
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,300
I mean, certainly we
saw a lot of teams

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,570
lose because they built
encampments around their base

47
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,150
and couldn't get out.

48
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,864
OK, so it seems
like a dumb thing

49
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,280
when you're looking
at it, but how

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,820
do you check for it in the code?

51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,740
What's the best way?

52
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,410
I mean, it would be
obvious to just try

53
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,380
to maintain a diagonal line
straight from you to the enemy

54
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,290
and never lay
bases on that line.

55
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,310
But maybe that's the only base.

56
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,400
So, I don't know
exactly what the best

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,830
way around that
kind of problem is.

58
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,580
Yeah so, the encampments
can block each other off,

59
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,950
or you could block
off the enemy.

60
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,220
We saw some of
them, you couldn't

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,360
get to those other ones.

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,752
Let's see if I can
open up that map.

63
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:39,210
Oh gosh, what are the chances
I'm going to be able to-- No,

64
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,360
the chances are zero.

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, I'll do it in
Paint because it's just

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,540
the general idea.

67
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,300
This was one of the
maps that I did design.

68
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,510
I didn't design all of them.

69
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,120
This was the one that
looked like-- Oh, I

70
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,662
guess I can just
use continual lines.

71
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:54,078
Oh man, this is going to be
great, it's going to be great,

72
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:55,190
I'm looking forward to it.

73
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,550
Yeah, it was just like that.

74
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,210
And then the encampments
where arranged a little bit

75
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,690
like this.

76
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,970
Yeah, yeah, it was like this.

77
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,470
These were the encampments and
they were connected this way.

78
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,678
So there was a pretty short--

79
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,280
[STUTTERING]

80
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,670
Distance between Team A and B.
So, Team A and B were there.

81
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,170
We had hero mines H and H
that would kill entire armies.

82
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,024
Actually, I'd said
that they went on

83
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,690
to be Supreme Commanders
in the Pacific,

84
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,590
but then they were subsequently
arrested for war crimes,

85
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,480
and executed.

86
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,340
But their descendants live
on, the map is still there.

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,262
So there you have it, the
cycle of life and history.

88
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,220
So anyway, the point that
I was trying to make,

89
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,860
before I confuse
myself here, was

90
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,210
that B would go ahead and
build a bunch of encampments

91
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,900
and then he wouldn't be able
to get to these ones back here.

92
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,100
He couldn't get to them
because he couldn't find them.

93
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,820
So, that's definitely
something to worry about.

94
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,160
Maybe what you should
do is say, I'm just

95
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,200
sort of speaking off
the top my head here,

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,300
is if you can't get
there and you're a robot

97
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,150
and you're trying
to path around them,

98
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,430
maybe you should send
a signal to this fellow

99
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,780
that he should suicide, and
then the team should remember,

100
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,539
from now on into
the future of time,

101
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,580
that they shouldn't try
to build something there.

102
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,760
And then maybe that'll
be the new route

103
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,669
to the expansion of new
colonies and exploring space

104
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:17,835
for the benefit of humanity.

105
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,470
So, we see that they
can be blocked off,

106
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,030
don't know exactly how
to fix that problem.

107
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,110
We saw other issues,
like Team 0 or 116.

108
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,410
They shouted attack and
they died at round 2,002.

109
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,180
That was too sad.

110
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,490
I have the match here.

111
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,900
And it was like
they were cut off

112
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,860
and maybe that was an exception.

113
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,050
So, definitely want
to look for exceptions

114
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,230
that will take place
if you're cut off.

115
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,550
And maybe just communicate
to the other bases,

116
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,000
hey, I'm cut off,
please kill yourself.

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,900
And I'm sure they'll comply.

118
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,080
Luckily, Battlecode is
not like the actual world

119
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,580
where it would be really hard
to make that argument to them.

120
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,515
They're like, yeah,
but, but it's me.

121
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,680
I've heard a little bit
about rush distance.

122
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,290
We had one map that
was called something

123
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,040
like, I don't remember
what it was called,

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,280
but we kept calling
it Bad Ideas.

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,380
Where the map was like this.

126
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,630
Oh man, that map was fantastic.

127
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't make this one.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,640
It had a big minefield
in the middle

129
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,330
and then there was a
and b located here.

130
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,460
And then on the very
edges of the map,

131
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,740
there were encampments
in these corners.

132
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,660
And so, the idea was that if
you actually take some of your,

133
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,390
you're pretty close
here, this distance

134
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,450
was, I don't know
15, or something.

135
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,140
And so, if you would send
your guys out in this way,

136
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,740
by the time you built the
encampment-- first of all,

137
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,540
you're losing soldiers,
second they're

138
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,249
not going to help you
defend, the enemy's

139
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:55,748
just going to go
ahead and kill you.

140
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:57,470
So, if you see this
distance, I mean,

141
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,110
I think a decent set
of heuristics for a map

142
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,980
should be the following.

143
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,650
Here's map heuristics.

144
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,730
[SLOWLY SPELLS HEURISTICS]

145
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,990
I think that you could
say, distance to enemy

146
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,740
and distance to
closest encampment.

147
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,070
[SLOWLY SPELLS ENCAMPMENT]

148
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,099
And then you could do, I
guess that's pretty much

149
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:23,640
all you need.

150
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,890
Because I think, distance
to enemy is unimportant.

151
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,250
What you should do
is number of mines

152
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,240
to the enemy and that
encapsulates distance.

153
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,430
And so, then you could be like,
OK, if this distance is big

154
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,880
and this number is
small, then there you go.

155
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,820
So, all you've got to do is say,
that number minus that number.

156
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,930
And now, you're starting
to have something

157
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,480
that you can compare to if
it's big, if this quantity is

158
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,880
greater than some number,
then do something.

159
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,420
Anyway, you guys get the idea.

160
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,650
We had a couple of maps where
we had lanes next to the mines.

161
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,010
I think we do that quite a bit.

162
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,050
Some of the maps that we
gave you initially, you

163
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,880
could just walk
straight to the enemy

164
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,590
if you path around the mines.

165
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,680
And the lanes weren't that
complicated, all you have to do

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
is make one little turn and
then you're going straight

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,970
to the enemy, all the way.

168
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,490
And we saw some teams
use this, but we also

169
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,844
saw them put
encampments on the lanes

170
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,260
and then they
couldn't walk there.

171
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,920
I think there was one very
critical match and that match

172
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,120
went something like this.

173
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,752
Are some of you
obsessive compulsive?

174
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,960
You're get a little bit
annoyed by these little bits?

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,386
OK, there you go.

176
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,010
I think on the map
that I'm describing,

177
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,990
it had these late like this.

178
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,210
And so, these are the
mines that I'm drawing

179
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,260
and then between those
we saw the encampments

180
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,750
that you could capture.

181
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,125
Some I'm just going to make
it slightly more symmetrical.

182
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,130
We had Team a over here
and Team b over here.

183
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,320
And the teams were just lined
up exactly with the mines.

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,089
So, that if you counted
the mines directly

185
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,130
between you and the enemy,
it was a large number,

186
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,580
but if you counted this
number, it was a zero number.

187
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,939
So what Team a started
doing, and I'll just

188
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,230
recap because not all of you
will have seen that match,

189
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,140
is they started defusing
these mines this way,

190
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,810
but simultaneously, they
were capturing encampments.

191
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,930
So, I believe they
didn't think that there

192
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,970
was a straight
path to the enemy.

193
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,880
Because whenever they
captured something,

194
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,700
they also got these
as soon as possible,

195
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,540
so they could never
really get around.

196
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,250
And simultaneously,
B was building up

197
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,660
a minefield and
researching nuke.

198
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,250
Yeah, nukes for the win.

199
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,750
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

200
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,809
PROFESSOR: So, I think
it was pretty weird.

201
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,200
We ended up seeing, I
guess you could classify it

202
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,169
as almost three
strategies, there's a rush,

203
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,900
there's an econ strategy, and
then there's a nuke strategy.

204
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,307
There's overlap, of
course, but it almost

205
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,890
seems like there are
three strategies.

206
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,360
In this map, for
this particular map,

207
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,974
we saw that econ-- he's
building these encampments,

208
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,140
if he didn't build those
he would have gone straight

209
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,765
to the enemy, it would have been
great-- this econ strategy was

210
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:03,960
defeated by the nuke.

211
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,570
So, I'm just going
to do an arrow.

212
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,980
Econ on a large map would
kill a rush and on a small map

213
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,670
a rush would kill a nuke.

214
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,360
Is this Rock, Paper, Scissors?

215
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,160
No, but given a map set it can
be rock, paper, scissors, e.

216
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,640
It could be scissors, e.

217
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,780
Anyway, the point
is that whenever

218
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,090
we have something like
this, if you're not

219
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,920
taking into account the maps,
so that it's just picking it

220
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,200
at random, then one
result that you get

221
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,860
is the tournament
can not make sense.

222
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,050
It's more than just some
simple concept in your head,

223
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,010
that the tournament
isn't making sense.

224
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,190
Because the basis
of a tournament

225
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,430
is that when it's done you
know who's the best, right.

226
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,190
It's supposed to be
that teams, they've

227
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,200
got a fundamental goodness,
and that the top team is best.

228
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,790
But if you have three teams,
rock, paper, and scissors,

229
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,874
and you hold a tournament, what
is the point of the tournament?

230
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,290
You're not to find anything
out at the end and, of course,

231
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,630
you all know this.

232
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,457
And my point is that you
feel it so viscerally

233
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:09,540
when it ends up happening.

234
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,850
So, the only solution
is to use that map data

235
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,130
and to say, OK, I
know it's a short map,

236
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,596
or I know it's a large map, or
something along those lines.

237
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,220
That's the only thing
you've got to do.

238
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,594
And I'm very
confident that we're

239
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:22,299
going to see a whole lot of
that in the following matches.

240
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,090
Not in the ones we're
going to watch today,

241
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,840
in the ones that are
going to be submitted

242
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,790
to the subsequent tournaments.

243
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,160
So, we saw the lanes
next to the mines.

244
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,330
We saw some really good
positioning of artillery.

245
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,390
It made the difference
between victory and loss

246
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,410
in a lot of cases.

247
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,170
And I'd like to
point out, especially

248
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,160
in the presence of
my simulator here,

249
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,760
that a little artillery
can go a long way.

250
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,490
So, I don't know
how many of you have

251
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,000
had a chance to look at the
latest update of my Battlecode

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,600
simulator, but it works
the following way.

253
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,640
So here, I'm going to
compare two strategies.

254
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,090
This strategy is to build robots
and no generators or suppliers

255
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,180
and this strategy
is just to continue

256
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,940
building two stands
for a supplier.

257
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,214
So, there you can see the
first strategy is in green.

258
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:10,130
How does that show up?

259
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,000
That shows up pretty well.

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,090
First strategy in green is
to just build the soldiers

261
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,180
and you hit the maximum.

262
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,850
And then, the second
strategy here,

263
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,830
you can see now in this updated
version of this Battlecode

264
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,660
simulator, that you
actually do lose some units.

265
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,120
You lose units that
you would have had,

266
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,610
those soldiers are destroyed
in capturing the encampments.

267
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,110
And then, you only
pay it off later.

268
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,700
So, here you see the
150 rounds, or so,

269
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,820
between starting to buy those
things and having it pay off.

270
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,880
And you can similarly
see that that round

271
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,200
number is going to change.

272
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,830
If you only build
two of these things,

273
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,855
it's going to be quite
different and, well, I

274
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,980
guess it ends up paying
off at about the same time.

275
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,860
That's curious,
that's pretty curious,

276
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,600
but I'm sure its basis in fact.

277
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,580
Let's just double check here.

278
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,890
The suppliers do reduce
your spawn delay.

279
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,990
So, here on the left,
I've provided a table.

280
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,820
And this is all available
on the internet.

281
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,180
So, you don't need
Mathematica, because I did also

282
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,470
save this is a PDF.

283
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,970
But you can make this
yourself in Microsoft Excel,

284
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,511
or something like that, where
you see the number of suppliers

285
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,610
on the left, going
from zero up on through

286
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,230
to some incredibly large number.

287
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,680
Which we did see in this
tournament, if you guys saw.

288
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,230
I really love to watch
some of those macro games.

289
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,180
And then, we see on the old
spec what the spawn delay would

290
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,250
have been and then
the latest spec.

291
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,810
So, the spec used to be
10 times 0.95 to the n,

292
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,520
where n is the
number of suppliers.

293
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,100
The latest spec is 100
divided by 10 plus n.

294
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,240
So, the effect is that now,
with the latest spawn delay,

295
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,290
we go down from 10 faster.

296
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,240
So, you see here, we're at six
when the old one was at seven.

297
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,820
But later on we're higher.

298
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,039
So, we level off much sooner.

299
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,330
And so, we're at two here
when the other one is at one.

300
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,670
So, there's a crossover and it's
favoring getting them earlier.

301
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,740
Anyway, my point is
we can go with number

302
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,440
of suppliers and
the spawn delay.

303
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
So, when I get one
supplier I should

304
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,610
see a spawn delay
that improves by one.

305
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,770
And so, you can say,
OK, the headquarters

306
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,550
is producing hit
points per round.

307
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,710
That's the point of
the headquarters.

308
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,570
I mean, sure number of
units is a different metric

309
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,820
than number of hit points.

310
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,840
Because units deal
damage, not hit points,

311
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,460
but it's similar because you're
dealing damage and taking

312
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,502
damage, and there you go.

313
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,960
It's all a question of micro
when you get right down to it,

314
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,850
it's all very clear
and straightforward.

315
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,490
So, hit points
per round is four.

316
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,430
If you build a single artillery.

317
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,490
OK, you build a single
supplier, now your spawn delay

318
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,340
is nine so you're producing 4.4
repeating hit points per round.

319
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,760
So, that's an additional 0.4
repeating hit points per round.

320
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,980
That's what you've got out
of building that supplier.

321
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,390
You got this.

322
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,730
And the next one you
build will get you this.

323
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,172
I mean, if you build this
one, you get even more.

324
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,630
I mean, some of them that you
build don't get you anything.

325
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,713
So, you can see, incremental
hit points per round.

326
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:58,710
But look, all these numbers,
none of them are that big.

327
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,660
Whereas, if you got
something like an artillery,

328
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,064
it can get you a large number
of hit points per round.

329
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,730
Because really what
you're interested in

330
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,359
is not just hit
points for your team,

331
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,900
it's the difference
between your team

332
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,150
and the enemy team hit points.

333
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,990
So if you build artillery
that does get shots off,

334
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,480
I mean, if it
shoots all the time,

335
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,180
then it's going to be dealing
40 damage every 20 turns.

336
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,000
And that's infinity, isn't it?

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,320
That's 40, 40 over, that's
two hit point per turn.

338
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,885
That's a lot.

339
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,260
I mean, of course,
it's not going

340
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,710
to do that because a lot of
the time it isn't shooting.

341
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,910
But if it's shooting only
20 percent of the time,

342
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,691
then it's two times one
fifth and now you have 0.4.

343
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,440
So, it's starting to
be competitive to get

344
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,960
an artillery compared
to a supplier.

345
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,020
So that's just one way
of looking at things.

346
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,680
Definitely worth thinking
about, I should say.

347
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,666
Because one of these
artilleries can be,

348
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,040
as we've seen in some of these
matches, worth its weight.

349
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,575
So now, the question is, is
this code working properly?

350
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,200
And I think the answer
is no, actually,

351
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,360
in characteristic fashion.

352
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,132
So, here I built one supplier
and the production rate

353
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,090
of robots is approximately
identical to the way

354
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,870
that it was.

355
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,990
So I'm just going to
debug this a second.

356
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,810
Let's see here.

357
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,976
I think we have
here, OK, so that's

358
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,850
the supplier number
there and the question is

359
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,680
if that supplier
number is there,

360
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,740
and the spawn time is being
updated, then why wouldn't it

361
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,570
take effect.

362
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,850
Because that certainly does
look like the latest spec.

363
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,120
Well, in any case, I think
it will be safe for us just

364
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,480
to start with one and that's
a decent fudge factor.

365
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,220
Let's do that.

366
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,270
Let's start with-- Oh my god,
I'm terrible, terrible person.

367
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,319
Let's see it happen.

368
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,360
I'll figure it out later.

369
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,443
So there, now we see a
little bit of a difference.

370
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,754
And we get the second
one that should have, OK,

371
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:34,670
that had a big effect.

372
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,005
Was it supposed to?

373
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:36,505
It was.

374
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,820
The third one should
have no effect.

375
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,370
Let's just double check that.

376
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,120
And then, what we're
going to end up doing

377
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,540
is we'll watch some matches.

378
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,490
OK, so let's go
back to having two.

379
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,160
And now, we'll go
to having three.

380
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,450
And yeah, the slope
didn't change.

381
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:49,880
I don't think the slope changed.

382
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,490
It just moved left
and right because we

383
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,500
had to lose another soldier.

384
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,230
So, that's good.

385
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,730
I think there was
just an offset of one.

386
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,450
I guess that makes perfect
sense to me for some reason.

387
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,630
Yeah, I'll understand it.

388
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,944
In fact, let's pretend
I understand it now.

389
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:04,360
It's just a question
of when we're

390
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,030
pretending I'm understanding
it, not a question of whether.

391
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,990
Alright, so, let's
go ahead and watch

392
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,540
some matches because
I really want

393
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,430
to illustrate a few interesting
things about mines, and micro,

394
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,500
and so on.

395
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,570
So let's go.

396
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,655
All of you can do it.

397
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,030
I don't know if
you've seen this,

398
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,540
but you simply go
to Tournaments,

399
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,832
and you go to Results, and
you click on Sprint Bracket,

400
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,248
and now you have
access to all the

401
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,540
matches that you can download.

402
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,364
I mean it's not as great as
being able to, for example,

403
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,030
get everybody else's code so you
can play against it infinitely,

404
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,250
but it's pretty good.

405
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,410
And you can also convert this
match data into XML files

406
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,030
that you can parse
to find matches

407
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,530
that match a certain
characteristic.

408
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,320
For instance, let's
just do an example.

409
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,550
I guess we'll just
pick any random match,

410
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,040
let's pick the final match.

411
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,114
Oh, I don't know, the
final match was-- I mean,

412
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,530
I think what ended
up happening is

413
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,480
we started having teams that
rushed get to the finals.

414
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,320
And I think that
was map dependent.

415
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,953
In the future, it may be
less so that rush teams are

416
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,369
really making it
up to the finals.

417
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,630
And there may be other,
like an econ team--

418
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,510
We see one of the best econ
teams here, hey I just met you,

419
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,810
was actually a cross
between rush and econ.

420
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,839
We saw them, sometimes, build
absolutely massive numbers

421
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,200
of macro buildings, and
other times we saw them not.

422
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,878
I see one question.

423
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,579
AUDIENCE: Are you going to have
best of five matches later?

424
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,829
PROFESSOR: Mr. Pipe Nexus?

425
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,530
AUDIENCE: Best of five matches.

426
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,150
PROFESSOR: Oh, best
of five matches.

427
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,660
That's been introduced
as a concept.

428
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,180
Sorry about my misunderstanding.

429
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,750
Best of five matches
may be introduced later,

430
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,350
but it's still on
the table because it

431
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,062
would require a large reworking
of our tournament code.

432
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,520
Because, of course,
we write things

433
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
in the most flexible and
reusable way possible.

434
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,954
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

435
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:47,866
And the question
about the previous one

436
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,740
that the suppliers
cost upkeep, right?

437
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,254
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I think they do.

438
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:54,920
We can actually go
straight into a match

439
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,380
and just double check that.

440
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,963
Because all we have
to do is go to one

441
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,030
of those matches where
one of the teams walls

442
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,140
itself in and just look at that.

443
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,499
Because then they have
suppliers, but not soldiers.

444
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:06,540
So, let's go to that one.

445
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,740
I think I have it
loaded already.

446
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,450
Those poor fellows.

447
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,600
I'm sorry Team 0, I'm
sorry, but here you go.

448
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,560
They have a supplier
and they are team 116.

449
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,340
And they're steady
at 225 resources.

450
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,729
Whereas, I don't
know, is that more

451
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,020
than they would be spending
if they were doing nothing?

452
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,050
I think it might be.

453
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,430
There's a chance
that it could be.

454
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,030
I'm going to go with yes.

455
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,980
But that's a guess.

456
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,570
I don't know.

457
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,280
I don't know.

458
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,350
It probably is.

459
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,042
It probably takes upkeep.

460
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,418
I guess that's
another thing that

461
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:43,708
may be wrong with my simulator.

462
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,510
Anyway, I'm tired of
saying that I'm wrong.

463
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,801
Let's talk about how I'm right.

464
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:47,600
Come on.

465
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,110
Come on guys.

466
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,680
Alright, so let's
open up a match.

467
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,600
I want to start before teams
that are rushing are winning.

468
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,100
Citizen Snips, for
example, I think,

469
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,780
was doing some decent macro.

470
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,120
So, let's open that one up.

471
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,340
I think I was pretty
impressed with that team.

472
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,312
There were also some teams
that were brand new that

473
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,770
came from the bottom
of the ladder.

474
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,126
And I think we'll have
a chance today to talk

475
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:12,500
about those a
little bit as well.

476
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,166
So, I'm just going
to make sure that I'm

477
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,590
looking at the latest one.

478
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,707
Oh man, please sort them.

479
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,290
Would you mind sorting
them, computer?

480
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,186
Thank you.

481
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:23,160
Man, I tell you, there's a
problem with subordination

482
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,180
these times.

483
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,370
So yeah, we see Team Snips, on
the right, is getting vision.

484
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,890
Vision was not a
very popular upgrade,

485
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,370
but they're building these
artillery in the front,

486
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,710
and then they're building
supplier in the back.

487
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,430
I think that a pretty
interesting approach.

488
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,290
And because of the
map layout, they're

489
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,800
ending up using the
artillery quite a bit.

490
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,570
So, we see a good shot
there, it's not bad.

491
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,700
It does seem to
deal some damage.

492
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,920
No, it deals no damage
to allied units.

493
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,740
So that's great.

494
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,469
But I think later on
we might see, yeah,

495
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,260
I don't know if that
was such a great shot.

496
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,540
Because we took out two
enemies at the cost of two

497
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,910
allied units.

498
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,387
So, I don't know, that seemed
like breaking even in my eyes.

499
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,970
So, there's something
you can do there

500
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,120
with writing artillery code
to try to avoid allied units.

501
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,370
Maybe, I don't know, you
shoot at-- You could literally

502
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,500
compute the value of every tile,
but it seems pretty expensive.

503
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,992
So, I'm not sure exactly what
the best way to do that is.

504
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:21,200
So, we see them getting
vision, one of the rare teams

505
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,020
to get vision.

506
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,520
And we see them upgrading
that, interlaced

507
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,120
with building their other robots
and their other structures.

508
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,834
So, I don't know how I
feel about interlacing

509
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:30,750
one thing and another.

510
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,760
So, I guess the idea
is that it's not

511
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,830
quite as fast as
researching it straight out,

512
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,940
but it's not quite
as slow as getting it

513
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,240
after you get all your robots.

514
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,180
But actually, when it
comes right down to it,

515
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,750
if you build, let's get
out a simple program here,

516
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,430
such as Paint.

517
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:54,700
If you build four robots,
1, 2, 3, and 4, and you

518
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,260
research 25%, which I'll
indicate as maybe there's

519
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
a completion bar.

520
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,430
And you research, I don't know,
this much, and then this much,

521
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,600
and then this much,
and then you're done.

522
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,590
How is that any different
from researching,

523
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,950
from getting robot,
robot, robot, robot,

524
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,646
and then getting
out the full bar?

525
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,270
I don't think it's
incredibly different

526
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,580
and it may be just that it
gives you more flexibility

527
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,220
to make decisions part way.

528
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,909
Because maybe if
you do this thing,

529
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,450
which I should change
the color here.

530
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,870
Maybe if you get three of
these straight out then

531
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,094
now you're fixed
and you can't finish

532
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:29,510
this for a certain
amount of time.

533
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,150
Whereas here, you give
yourself more flexibility

534
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,790
to cancel this part way through.

535
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,790
But I just feel like this
is the stronger move.

536
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,370
Because if you go up against
this team versus that team,

537
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,900
then if there's an engagement
at time, this time,

538
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,990
then right then and there you're
going to have four on three.

539
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,970
And so, when it
comes down to here,

540
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,620
you're going to
have two guys left

541
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,210
and he's going to have one guy.

542
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,737
And it's going to be pretty
clear who's going to win.

543
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:56,320
And it doesn't matter
that both of you

544
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,445
have this stuff at the end.

545
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,590
It's just not going
to matter, so I

546
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,480
don't know how I feel
about the interlacing.

547
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,900
So, we see a bunch of that.

548
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,620
And we also see
here that Team 70

549
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,640
is a team that either rushes,
or goes for a heavy macro play.

550
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,480
And I get the feeling
that on this map,

551
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,790
they've decided that the rush
distance, the distance from one

552
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,720
team to the other, is not huge.

553
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,680
It's not that big.

554
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,750
And so, and there aren't
that many mines either.

555
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,870
So, I think this is the reason
why they're doing this rush.

556
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,350
I think it's pretty impressive
that even though they're

557
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,810
down on units, pretty often we
see two units from blue and one

558
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,020
unit from red,
nevertheless, red is

559
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,160
able to hold off
this blue attack.

560
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,040
I think Team 70 has some
really excellent micro.

561
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,610
And I will remind you that
Team 70 has one author who

562
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,730
was a former member
of a team with Corey.

563
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,620
Who spoke yesterday at lecture.

564
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,990
And you remember that Corey
talked all about micro.

565
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,594
Micro being the important
thing that wins matches.

566
00:22:57,594 --> 00:22:59,260
We're going to see
that again and again.

567
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,730
You saw that the
Sprint Tournament.

568
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,800
And I have ways of
indicating again to you,

569
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,260
in video that we watch today,
that that was incredibly key

570
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,010
in a lot of circumstances.

571
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,867
We saw that happen.

572
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,450
And so, it makes
perfect sense that we

573
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,870
would see red have
some really good micro.

574
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,550
But at the same
time, he's not going

575
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,320
to make any inroads against this
player who's doing artillery.

576
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,620
And you've got to wonder
whether that's detectable.

577
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,457
Whether he can tell that
he's dying to artillery.

578
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:24,040
And whether he can
tell the main base,

579
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,150
hey, this is our
artillery, so we've

580
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,690
got basically two choices.

581
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,000
One, we bunch up a
lot of units and we

582
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,780
make sure we attack all at
once and spread out enough

583
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,190
so we're not taking splash
damage from that artillery.

584
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,890
Or, we've got to get
shields, or we've

585
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,480
got to do a massive econ play.

586
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,570
Basically, we've got
those three choices.

587
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,910
And neither of those choices,
neither of those three,

588
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,350
are among the choice
of just simply sending

589
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,140
one unit at a time.

590
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,090
So, I think a lot--

591
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,720
Now see, did you
see that happen?

592
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,200
That's pretty surprising.

593
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,140
You see the enemy attack
and you see red outnumbered.

594
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,790
So, this is two
enemies to one red.

595
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,470
OK, and the two
enemies are grouping

596
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,056
around the enemy headquarters.

597
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:06,680
Because they're not
really prioritizing

598
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,620
attacking that one red guy.

599
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,710
They're just going toward
the enemy, it seems.

600
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,740
It's not, I mean,
it's not that obvious

601
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,140
that they're
prioritizing enemy units.

602
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,015
So what ends up happening
is this one red guy

603
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:21,730
is managing to kite and
attack only one blue guy.

604
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,360
See that?

605
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,304
And, I guess, there's
probably awesome stuff

606
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:27,470
that you could read in their
indicator strings here.

607
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,310
Remember that when we
show the tournament,

608
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,220
the indicator string
bar is not there.

609
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,230
That's just not part of
the tournament viewer.

610
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,470
But if you watch the replay,
you can read their indicator

611
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,969
strings and you might learn
some about what those robots are

612
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:39,780
trying to think about,
or trying to do.

613
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,267
So, here you see the red is
really kiting these guys.

614
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:43,850
And he's almost using
his headquarters

615
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,850
as a defensive structure.

616
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,560
You can see here,
he's almost come back

617
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,070
because he's got two units
and this guy's capturing

618
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,100
an encampment and you
can't cancel that.

619
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,949
So, he's almost
recovering here and just

620
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:55,990
through the use of micro.

621
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,270
I think it's very impressive.

622
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,000
And it's only because he
walks into that artillery fire

623
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,250
again that it seems like
he has some trouble.

624
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,880
I mean, there are multiple ways
of reading the system, reading

625
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,582
what happened in this match.

626
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:09,290
But, I think that was
pretty interesting.

627
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,780
This is one of the only
shields that we ever see.

628
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,510
I don't see any reason why blue
would have decided to build it,

629
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,759
especially in this location,
especially given this guy

630
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,170
has no artillery, especially,
especially, especially.

631
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,910
So, I think this game's
pretty much foregone.

632
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,780
And I think this one
is also foregone.

633
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,800
OK, here's a great example.

634
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,980
So he has built three suppliers.

635
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,600
OK, three suppliers
out of Team 216.

636
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,890
And there you go, he has 180.

637
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,337
Whereas, at the beginning, I
think you were stable at 194.

638
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:39,670
So there we have our definitive
answer to that question.

639
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,730
I think you are stable at 194,
so these do take hit point,

640
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,917
they do take and upkeep,
these supplier units

641
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,000
that he does end up doing.

642
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,680
So, that's good.

643
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,940
That makes me feel happy.

644
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,315
So that goes on
to a round three.

645
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,576
I mean, yeah, you've
got to check that.

646
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:53,450
OK, I've said it before,
don't want to repeat

647
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,240
myself, very good.

648
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,515
So, Team 70, both teams are
deciding this is a macro map.

649
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,140
Pretty interesting,
because once again,

650
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,170
we saw team 70 not do macro.

651
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,770
But look at this, he's not
running straight for macro.

652
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,340
He's got this decision in mind.

653
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,450
That's one generator
and four suppliers.

654
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,110
Wow, let's just rewind, just
rewind just a little bit,

655
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,790
just a little bit right now.

656
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,920
So yeah, he's getting
the generator first

657
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,980
and then those three.

658
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,020
Meanwhile, he's getting fusion.

659
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,250
He's already got fusion.

660
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,420
And I think he
prioritizes that upgrade.

661
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,910
It's pretty strange because
you see him, I think,

662
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,980
get it before even
is first unit.

663
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,730
So here, we're
looking at round 20.

664
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,510
Round 15,16, 17, he still
hasn't built a unit.

665
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,526
Whereas, blue has built
two units already.

666
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:34,400
It's questionable whether
prioritizing fusion

667
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,550
is going to be that good,
because he prioritizes

668
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,920
fusion but then doesn't
actually use all that energy.

669
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,640
He's still at 1,600.

670
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,320
Does he ever actually use it?

671
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,960
Maybe.

672
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,100
It's going to be later.

673
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,900
And this team could
be even more powerful

674
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,294
than it was, perhaps,
if it perhaps

675
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:51,460
did that a little bit later.

676
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,920
So yeah, let's go back and
let's think about this.

677
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,730
Because this set
up here is meant

678
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,130
to strike at a certain time.

679
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,042
And the time when
he's meant to strike,

680
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,000
imagine setting up this
way, where you're like,

681
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,290
OK, I know that depending on
the number of macro buildings

682
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,490
I build, that will give
me an attack timing.

683
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,400
Where it'll be the
perfect moment for me

684
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,566
to attack because I'm just
running out of resources,

685
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,380
I'm just hitting
the peak of units.

686
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,900
Well, maybe that attack
timing should exactly

687
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,430
match how long I
estimate it will

688
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,072
take for me to get to the enemy.

689
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,530
Now, you could use
the headquarters

690
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,480
to say, to just
calculate explicitly,

691
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,530
it will take me this
long to get the enemy,

692
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,700
I had better have some
macro up by that time.

693
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,500
And that could be
exactly what he's doing.

694
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,300
So, let's do a little
check in Mathematica,

695
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,387
where we'll say he's going to
build four of these suppliers

696
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,970
and he's going to
build one generator.

697
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,260
So there, we see that
he's going to cross over

698
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,820
and he's going to be even
with the enemy at 200.

699
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,410
So, let's hope that he attacks
the enemy closer to 300.

700
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,530
Let's see what happens.

701
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,207
So there, he's just pausing.

702
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,290
All his units are pausing.

703
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,310
It's round 269, they're
not doing anything.

704
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,960
It's round 300, they're
still not doing anything.

705
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,810
I guess it's because he's taking
more bases that he's decided,

706
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,060
OK, I have something,
that's a lot of units.

707
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,890
I'm pretty sure this
is a defensive move.

708
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,431
That he's just going
to move out here

709
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,870
and he's expecting
these to defend him.

710
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,690
Unfortunately,
that's not exactly

711
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,554
on the midpoint
between the two armies.

712
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,970
And you've got to wonder whether
that's a deliberate idea,

713
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,400
or whether he's chosen
to go in this direction

714
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,702
for some other reason.

715
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:17,910
Because we're going to see
blue go ahead and take out

716
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,470
a lot of those
bases, a lot of that

717
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,060
stuff that he had on the bottom.

718
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,620
So, we see once again
that red ends up using,

719
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,520
and does in most
of his matches, he

720
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,910
ends up using his reinforcing
stream as a defensive tool.

721
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,760
If he didn't have
that stream of units

722
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,830
continually coming
out of the base,

723
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,810
there's no way he would
be able to defend this.

724
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,351
Because these guys
are not programmed

725
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,520
to turn around and come back.

726
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,120
Once again, blue has this
great, look at this positioning.

727
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,956
I think it's probably not
just great positioning.

728
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:49,830
It's probably just that
every other time he's

729
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,913
building one or the other.

730
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:52,580
Because we see another
artillery here,

731
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,480
and here, and here, and
here, and here, whereas red

732
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,210
has not built a
single artillery.

733
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,040
So the question is,
is it the building

734
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,700
of one thing or
another that has made

735
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,080
the difference in this match?

736
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,360
Because we're
starting to see red

737
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,400
is starting to get
a lot more units.

738
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,410
And that artillery is
not always shooting.

739
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,775
So, I think it's a
pretty open question

740
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,150
whether it was
actually worth it.

741
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,880
Because in this long
match, it ends up

742
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,110
being that red prevails.

743
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,290
So yeah, I mean, that's
pretty interesting how red

744
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,530
has got a relatively
simple move.

745
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,370
He's just picking rush or econ.

746
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,370
And when he goes econ,
he goes econ all the way,

747
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,960
and when he goes rush,
he goes rush all the way,

748
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,210
and his micro is fantastic.

749
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,890
And those little things alone,
little, though I may call them,

750
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,300
are really significant.

751
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,270
OK, so that's spending a
long time on just one match.

752
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,300
Let's look a little bit,
let's look a little bit

753
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,260
at Game of Death.

754
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,120
Game of Death is a team
that started out really low.

755
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,030
So, let's see here,
Game of Death.

756
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,710
So, we can click on them
here under Battlecode Teams.

757
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,020
We see that they were
13 and 3, their ranking

758
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,860
was at the bottom of
the scrimmage ranks.

759
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,800
So, let's have a look at how
they made it up to round four

760
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,500
from the very bottom round.

761
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,934
They had a bad seed
at the beginning

762
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,600
and they made it all
the way up to here.

763
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,370
How were they able to do that?

764
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,192
Because they must be
doing something right.

765
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,150
What's this turnaround?

766
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,820
Let's, have a look at this.

767
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,855
So, I'm going to go
over here and I'm

768
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:20,030
going to run that match.

769
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,540
And I'm pretty sure we'll
have time to talk about all

770
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,210
of the interesting things
that happen in this one

771
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,440
and in the next ones.

772
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,040
So, here on the right,
we have that team,

773
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,580
that new team
which is upsetting,

774
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,174
one after another, other team.

775
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:39,590
And he's going to
build suppliers,

776
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,230
so he's built two suppliers,
and he's building a few mines

777
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,400
around the headquarters.

778
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,230
And it looks like
he's just rolling

779
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,927
over team 172 which
was Drunkasaurus.

780
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,010
Drunkasaurus is another
one of these rush players,

781
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,640
and you'd expect rush to be
pretty effective on this map.

782
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,750
So what happened?

783
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,620
I think it's worth mentioning
that a rush player would

784
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,390
do well.

785
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,360
If this rush player is not
really pathing around mines,

786
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,830
if that's not the
way that they're

787
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,540
planning to play the
game, then they probably

788
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,230
ought to get defusion.

789
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,820
I mean they've spent a
few rounds buying fusion,

790
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,279
doesn't make that
much sense to me.

791
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,570
I think you might get one
free around at the beginning.

792
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,195
It seems like a lot
of people will just

793
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:20,980
put one point into something.

794
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,580
But the amount of
time it takes him

795
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,821
to get the enemy he can compute
because he just went straight

796
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:26,320
there.

797
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,530
So, he can compute that time
and he can say, alright,

798
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,762
was that worth it.

799
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,470
It's also worth
mentioning that, I think,

800
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,928
in a lot of these
engagements, he's

801
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:36,050
busy defusing mines
during combat.

802
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,800
And like we said
before, you can't

803
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,090
attack while you're
defusing a mine.

804
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,350
So, part of the best
reason of getting defusion

805
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,970
is so that you only have
five rounds of inaction.

806
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,315
So that, let's say,
nobody's around.

807
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:52,870
It's perfectly safe, great
time to defuse a mine.

808
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,490
So, you start
defusing that mine.

809
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,450
Now, you see the enemy.

810
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,300
You can't cancel the
defusion process.

811
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,210
So, if you were going to
do a 12-turn diffusion

812
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,700
and you see the enemy and
he's at a distance of,

813
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,150
wait, what's the distance?

814
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,710
All we have to do is look it up.

815
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,420
So, let's go to my
Useful Specs document,

816
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,720
which is neither
handy nor dandy.

817
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,350
It's, in fact, much more
serious and much more useful

818
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,460
than both of those
terms would suggest.

819
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,470
So, range 14 is
your sight range.

820
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,539
You can see a unit
that's three tiles away.

821
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,080
I can zoom in a
little bit more here.

822
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,830
It's rastered, so it
looks kind of silly.

823
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,850
I always think it's interesting
how when you raster something,

824
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,270
sometimes it becomes
orange on one side

825
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,390
and blue on the other side.

826
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,070
I'm sure some of you in
this room understand it.

827
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,819
And I'm sure that some
of you in this room

828
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,890
don't care to understand
it and never want to.

829
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,756
So, he's three units
away, right, the enemy

830
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,130
is three units
away, and you just

831
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,030
started defusing
the round before.

832
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,150
So if that's a
12-round defusion,

833
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,350
then by the time he
gets to you, you've

834
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,020
still got seven or nine rounds
left, if you subtract correctly

835
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,569
and depending on the turn
counts, and whatever.

836
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,110
That's a lot of time
that you're just

837
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,820
going to spend doing nothing.

838
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,986
And how long does it take
for the enemy to kill you?

839
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,810
They deal six damage per
round, you have 40 hit points.

840
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,650
I can't divide, but that sounds
like seven-ish, seven rounds.

841
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,470
Well, look at that, so you had
12, you didn't see anybody,

842
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,270
they had time to approach
and kill you and go away

843
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,230
before you finished.

844
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,710
That's really lousy.

845
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,211
Even if they get
one hit off on you,

846
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:12,793
that's going to make
a huge difference

847
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:14,360
because this is a
knife edge game.

848
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,570
It's a game of instabilities
because we don't start you off

849
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,284
with a command center that
deals damage, for example.

850
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:22,325
We don't give you that
many defensive advantages.

851
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:24,965
So, as soon as the enemy gets
a couple more units in you,

852
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:27,090
it's just going to start
pushing in that direction,

853
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,330
unless they start
making mistakes.

854
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,830
So, that's one of
the reasons why

855
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,680
defusing a mine without
defusion and without vision

856
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,560
is a problem.

857
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,480
Let's say you have both
vision and defusion.

858
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,860
I mean, of course, they're
very expensive upgrades,

859
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,460
but let's say you've got them.

860
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,430
Well now, it's only
going to take five rounds

861
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,030
to defuse something
and you have can

862
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,560
see a unit that's
five tiles away.

863
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,610
So, let's say he's over
here, you don't see him,

864
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,610
you start defusing.

865
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,050
Now, he's starting to show up
and he's moving toward you.

866
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,720
By the time he gets there,
you're done defusing

867
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,900
and you can start shooting.

868
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,282
That's a pretty big difference.

869
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:00,990
And I think that's
one of the reasons why

870
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,010
we see a lot of
successful rush teams

871
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,900
go ahead and get that defusion.

872
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,600
Whereas, we see Drunkasaurus
here not getting defusion.

873
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,730
We see decent micro
on both teams' side.

874
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,080
I don't know exactly if this is
good micro coming out of both,

875
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,750
there's certainly a
lot of motion going on.

876
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,699
It's anybody's guess.

877
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,739
Here both teams
are defusing mines.

878
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,630
They're just
watching each other,

879
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:28,199
maybe they're playing Parcheesi
with the mine defusion,

880
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,790
exchanging tips on how
not to get blown up.

881
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,900
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

882
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,409
PROFESSOR: I think it's
a very odd thing to see,

883
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,150
I think it's quite strange.

884
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,760
But yeah, the point
has been made,

885
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,850
the point has been
abundantly made.

886
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,513
Another thing, if
you're retreating

887
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:44,929
and you are adjacent
to the enemy,

888
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,428
I think we've seen
this a lot, and I

889
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:49,080
think that is what's going
on in some of these cases,

890
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,113
maybe this guy is
adjacent to the enemy

891
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:53,540
and maybe he's retreating
because he's got one energon.

892
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,719
He's like, get me
the hell out of here.

893
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,610
I think he's maybe or was
trying to retreat at some point,

894
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,820
but it's a bad idea
to defuse a mind when

895
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,180
you're adjacent to the enemy.

896
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,440
Don't start, just don't start.

897
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,400
It's like smoking,
just don't start.

898
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Yes, this advertisement
brought to you

899
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,560
by the American
Society for lungs.

900
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,750
I don't know, I just
thought that sounded right.

901
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,300
So yeah, here once again we see
this is the same two players.

902
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,250
But in this case, the blue
team just, I don't know,

903
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,500
he's dancing, or something.

904
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,810
It's not super effective.

905
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,300
He's building nukes.

906
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,347
Somehow he's decided, yeah,
now's the time to get nukes.

907
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:32,180
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

908
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,890
PROFESSOR: I've gotten
Pickaxe, but I'm not using it.

909
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,200
So, I think, but no, to be fair,
I think, what he's trying to do

910
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
is lay a bunch of
mines into a minefield.

911
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,404
And he's doing that
using his Pickaxe.

912
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,820
But, I think, maybe
he's thinking,

913
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,070
alright, there's a
lot of neutral mines,

914
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,590
these are supposed to help me
out, I shouldn't destroy them.

915
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:53,690
But nevertheless, the red team
is able to just roll this over,

916
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,950
so it does go on to a
third a third match.

917
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,230
But what a difference.

918
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,370
What a difference we see here.

919
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,120
He's getting close
to his maximum.

920
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,400
But we see he's
optimized for this.

921
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,150
Look at his units.

922
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,660
He's using 500 bytecodes,
that's effectively zero.

923
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,490
So, he's going to be able to
get up to the full 40 units.

924
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,350
And that strength
of that 40 units,

925
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,600
what is the strength
point of that 40 units?

926
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,120
Well, let's simply go back
here to here, to here.

927
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,300
That 400 round counter?

928
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,304
That's exactly when
you hit your maximum

929
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:27,720
if you haven't
built any upgrades.

930
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,210
And that's exactly when he
arrives at the enemy base.

931
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,130
So, unless we start changing
the maps, not getting upgrades

932
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,410
is going to be fine for you.

933
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,000
As long as you're
not doing what he

934
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,002
did in the last round,
which was somehow bad.

935
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:43,960
I mean, you've got to
have that clump of units.

936
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,190
And, I think, one thing
that we see again and again,

937
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,864
is once a team loses
its clump of units

938
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:50,030
it sends them in one by one.

939
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,870
Now, it's not obvious
but that's a bad idea.

940
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,700
Because we've seen
teams win that way.

941
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,510
So, what do you do?

942
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,740
OK, now that was pretty
one-sided, what happened there?

943
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,550
Did blue have more units
or did red have more units.

944
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,370
OK, let's go and say
this is three by five.

945
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,730
So that's 15 units because
these three go into it,

946
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,600
and that's 18.

947
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,700
So, that's 18 units.

948
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,540
This is three by five
with three missing,

949
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,040
so that's 15 units plus,
OK, that's 18,19, 20.

950
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,250
So, this guy's got 20.

951
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,757
I guess that accounts for these
guys that blue left behind.

952
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:20,090
So red's got a slight advantage.

953
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,932
All teams are defusing mines,
these two could be fighting.

954
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:25,890
There is no reason for
them not to be fighting.

955
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,180
Now, red has managed to kill
this guy off very handily,

956
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,910
because of that advantage.

957
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,760
We saw before, in
Corey's lecture,

958
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
how he's talking
about this being

959
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,720
a very unstable situation,
where if you've got

960
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,200
one gap between the two.

961
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,880
The person who closes
that gap first will win.

962
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,170
So, let's see if somebody's
going to close that gap.

963
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,120
Well, now look at how
much damage blue is doing?

964
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,810
That's pretty
impressive and, I think,

965
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,389
part of that is we're seeing
that a lot of red's units

966
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:52,680
are just spending time
defusing, this one and this one,

967
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,890
in particular, also this one,
which is right in the middle.

968
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,780
These three in the back,
definitely not ones to ignore.

969
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,910
So yeah, blue ends
up coming in here

970
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,670
and capitalizes on
a little advantage.

971
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,070
Now, red, OK, red
is still attacking.

972
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,506
There's a point in this battle.

973
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:11,130
One of things about
battles is that you

974
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,680
know where the enemy is.

975
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,420
Right, so you can
make that count.

976
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,650
You can count them,
you can say, alright,

977
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,960
we're about to lose this battle.

978
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,450
Here's an interesting
question for you.

979
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,075
You're losing a
battle, what do you do?

980
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:21,970
Do you call for
reinforcements and say, OK,

981
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,040
if we have more reinforcements,
we won't lose as badly?

982
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,640
Or, do you say to
the reinforcements,

983
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,265
please go back to
the base and regroup,

984
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,640
it's your only chance to live?

985
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,450
I mean, I don't think we have,
I'm hitting the b button,

986
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,890
there's no broadcast
going on in the whole map.

987
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,432
But you could imagine
the case where

988
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:40,890
they would be like,
OK, I'm telling

989
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,260
my allies get the
hell out of there.

990
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,030
And this guy, so, he sees
a very bad situation,

991
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,550
and here he's two tiles
away from an enemy.

992
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,660
He's got the choice.

993
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,580
Do I move?

994
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,705
Close that gap?

995
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:55,080
I mean, that's a
bad idea, right?

996
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,329
From Corey's lecture, you
don't close a gap of two,

997
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,370
because then you won't
have the attack advantage.

998
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,020
That's not a good idea.

999
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,250
But what's he going to do?

1000
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,572
So, let's click on it.

1001
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:04,280
Oh, look at that.

1002
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,847
He moved in.

1003
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:06,180
And what's he going to do again?

1004
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,070
Oh, he's kiting a
little bit well,

1005
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,590
he's only fighting
one of the enemy.

1006
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,800
That's not so bad, but he
ends up being destroyed.

1007
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,142
I mean, what can he expect.

1008
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,600
I think it would
be very reasonable

1009
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,170
for you to write
code that says, OK,

1010
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,044
if the enemy is there,
what am I going to do.

1011
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:19,890
A lot of times we've
seen teams back away.

1012
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,290
They try to do a retreat.

1013
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,240
Of course, a retreat doesn't
work if you're already engaged.

1014
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,448
Let's say you're not engaged.

1015
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:27,230
OK, we're smart people, we don't
retreat when we're engaged,

1016
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,560
that would be a bad idea.

1017
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
We keep with it.

1018
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
We have our commitment.

1019
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,185
But we back out.

1020
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:33,060
Where do we back out?

1021
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,304
We've seen teams, time and
again, try to back away

1022
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:37,720
and then they get stuck, because
there's mines in the way.

1023
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,480
They only cleared a very narrow
path through to the enemy.

1024
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,200
So, why not remember
the path that you

1025
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,810
took to get to that enemy,
so that you can then, just

1026
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,110
follow that backwards?

1027
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,010
You have omnidirectional
view, so that might work.

1028
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,800
It might not, it might
be a terrible idea.

1029
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,250
But I'm just putting
it out there.

1030
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,370
Because you can save map
locations pretty easily,

1031
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,410
to an array.

1032
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,740
And then, it's, OK, just
pop that array back.

1033
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,610
So, you're pushing
to an array and then

1034
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,500
you're popping the
array values back,

1035
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,070
so it's its own ordered
list of where I've been,

1036
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,900
and where I want to
go back to, and what

1037
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,090
I want to do with my
life, and whether I

1038
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,880
want to visit Paris
and eat baguettes.

1039
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,860
So it's a full integrated
system for traveling the world.

1040
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,290
And, I think, red
could definitely

1041
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,450
benefit from that, especially
in a case like this.

1042
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,449
I mean, would he be able
to come back from this?

1043
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:20,180
Probably no.

1044
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,680
I mean, just a little bit
of macro from blue, I think,

1045
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,750
ends up making a
huge difference.

1046
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,320
But nevertheless,
it's worth mentioning.

1047
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,860
So, why does red
not win this map?

1048
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,866
We've seen rush teams do well.

1049
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:33,490
I think it's just
because blue actually

1050
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,900
built any units at all.

1051
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,870
But there you have it.

1052
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,570
Good game.

1053
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,840
That's a good game.

1054
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,450
Let's make sure that we're
getting to everything.

1055
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,630
So, we've seen some games
where we had a run around.

1056
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,390
Where one team would
run around, would

1057
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,557
circumvent the other
team, and deal damage

1058
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:50,390
to the headquarters.

1059
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,112
As we've said before, the
win condition is as follows.

1060
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:55,320
I don't think we've been
that straightforward on what

1061
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,879
the win conditions are.

1062
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,920
First and foremost, it's
a headquarter hit point.

1063
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,170
So if you can get one
hit off the enemy,

1064
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,170
that's a good time
to just back out.

1065
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,780
Maybe, the time now is
to just lay some mines

1066
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,780
and play defensively.

1067
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,540
As long as you have registered
a hit on the enemy headquarters.

1068
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,660
Let's say, if your soldier
moves to the enemy headquarters

1069
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,840
and is adjacent, that's a nice
time for him to broadcast,

1070
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,050
hey, I was adjacent to the
enemy headquarters, ergo,

1071
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,260
I did damage to him.

1072
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,420
That's a given.

1073
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,730
That's always true.

1074
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,380
Unless the enemy has a med bay
adjacent to his headquarters,

1075
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,266
dealing damage-- No,
that's not going to work?

1076
00:41:33,266 --> 00:41:34,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1077
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,790
PROFESSOR: Well,
there you go folks,

1078
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,980
you've heard it from the words
of somebody knowledgeable.

1079
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,004
So yeah, so there you
go, so you would know,

1080
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:45,170
so you could message and
you could play defensively.

1081
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,150
Headquarter hit points
first and foremost,

1082
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,350
number of encampments,
second, number of mines,

1083
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,060
third, number of
robots, third, fourth.

1084
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,067
Good one.

1085
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:56,400
Yeah, so we saw some runarounds.

1086
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,990
We saw some teams
running around the enemy.

1087
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,710
And we've also seen,
especially at the lower

1088
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,220
levels of the bracket, if your
headquarters is under attack,

1089
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,860
it is of paramount
importance, tantamount

1090
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,470
to paramount importance, that
you come back and defend it.

1091
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,520
Definitely worth
sending a signal.

1092
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,100
Allied soldiers, either
protect me or just declare

1093
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,119
yourselves null and
void and you're not

1094
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,410
going to get a Christmas bonus.

1095
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,030
So, like I said before, Game
of Death was a great team.

1096
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,970
We saw them get really far.

1097
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,080
Velociraptors,
Drunkasaurus, and Cortege,

1098
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,140
we saw them rush and be
very effective with that.

1099
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,570
There are ways of making
a rush more effective,

1100
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,910
we saw them do those things.

1101
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,970
I think it was very impressive.

1102
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,530
We saw Soda, which was
a really good team.

1103
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,690
They did well in the
newbie tournament last year

1104
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,289
and I'm excited to see
them back again this year.

1105
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:52,830
There were certain
things they didn't

1106
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,170
do that we're kind of
strange and a lot of teams

1107
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,080
here probably felt that
they could have done better.

1108
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,650
These little edge cases
end up being so important.

1109
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,770
On Little Forts, they're
standing right next

1110
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,550
to the enemy, this
was so sad, they're

1111
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,550
standing right next to
the enemy while the enemy

1112
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,367
researchers nuke.

1113
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,700
And they're surrounding them,
they've got tons of units,

1114
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,908
but they just didn't move in.

1115
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:14,290
I mean, there's this certain
state machine code, maybe

1116
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,020
a couple of mines, maybe
they had indigestion.

1117
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,510
There's clearly a good reason,
but they just didn't do it.

1118
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,880
And checking for those edge
cases is just so hard to do.

1119
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
I think is all going to
be so cleared up though.

1120
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,660
We're going to see
some great stuff.

1121
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,270
Hey, I Just Met You, again,
we saw their bipolar response

1122
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:34,870
to maps.

1123
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,890
I thought that was
just fantastic,

1124
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,310
absolutely fantastic.

1125
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,860
I want to finish by
talking a little bit

1126
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,810
about the way the game
might change in the future.

1127
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,370
So, you saw certain specs
and you saw certain maps.

1128
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,745
This is the kind of thing that
we change after the Sprint

1129
00:43:53,745 --> 00:43:55,286
Tournament or the
Seeding Tournament,

1130
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:57,250
where we go, OK, we want
to tweak this a little

1131
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,150
to make sure the
game is interesting.

1132
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,880
That's our big focus.

1133
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,580
We want the game
to be interesting.

1134
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,830
We don't want it to be random.

1135
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,760
We want to showcase how
amazing you guys are.

1136
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,990
So if it ends up being the
case that rushes are the best

1137
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,830
and that a little
bit of microcode

1138
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,750
makes a difference
between winning and losing

1139
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,870
100% of the time, I don't
think that that's great.

1140
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:17,660
I don't like that.

1141
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,970
So, let's say that
there could be changes.

1142
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,050
Now, when you hear
that, you probably go,

1143
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,080
aha, he's going to tell
me the changes that

1144
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,505
are going to
happen, but he's not

1145
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:28,130
allowed to tell me
the changes, so he's

1146
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,280
going to tell them
hypothetically,

1147
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,490
but they will actually happen.

1148
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,864
But no, that's not the case,
I'm just coming up with them

1149
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:34,810
hypothetically, I guarantee it.

1150
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,210
OK, so the changes are,
OK, we've got a nuke.

1151
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,850
The nuke is 400 rounds.

1152
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:44,900
OK, we have the
maximum soldier count

1153
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,370
for a rush is at 400 rounds.

1154
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,517
We've seen that using my
Mathematica simulator,

1155
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,350
we've seen it with
soldiers, I'm sure you've

1156
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,870
written it yourself.

1157
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,190
I mean, it's
technically 200 rounds

1158
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,940
if you're computing
digits of pi.

1159
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,440
Yeah, because, as
we've said before, that

1160
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,160
would mean that you have
a whole lot less tabs.

1161
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,040
So, that's 400 rounds.

1162
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,780
The minimum distance
between headquarters is 10.

1163
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,780
The maximum distance
between headquarters

1164
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,850
is, I think we said it was
200 rounds of walking mining.

1165
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,460
I think that's what
we said it was.

1166
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,510
So, in the current
set, you're not

1167
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,250
going to get a map
that's 400 on the side.

1168
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,010
I think the maximum
we said is 70.

1169
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,330
So, if it were 70 on
a side, then there

1170
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,370
would be exactly 70
mines between you

1171
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,060
and the enemy times 5
rounds per mine is 350.

1172
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,460
So that's absolute
worst, worst, worst,

1173
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,410
that it could possibly be and
that would look like this.

1174
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,010
That would be all
grey, full of mines.

1175
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,510
And that's just not
going to happen.

1176
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,140
Realistically, we're going
to put in some silly path,

1177
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,700
and you can just walk there.

1178
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,710
So, with the current
spec, the point

1179
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,499
that I'm trying to make-- I
mean, OK, you could add 25

1180
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,290
because it'll take you
a little bit of time

1181
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,150
to research defusion,
so you can get

1182
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,470
to the other side-- but my
point is that this is only 350.

1183
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,950
And so, you're really only going
to have 200 rounds of walking.

1184
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,480
And the fact is we don't want to
get that close to that number,

1185
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,600
so we end up 99% of
the time, right now

1186
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,413
we're making it 100
rounds of walking.

1187
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:25,871
AUDIENCE: That
would be six, right?

1188
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:28,204
Because you're moving for
five rounds and then you move,

1189
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:29,690
right?

1190
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,680
PROFESSOR: OK, sure so it's six.

1191
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,180
Very good.

1192
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:40,010
So that's a six and that's
a 420 + 25 = ugly, no,

1193
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,350
it's a-- I don't
know, it's ugly.

1194
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,467
You made my diagram ugly.

1195
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,050
You know what?

1196
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,860
I'd rather be correct
than beautiful.

1197
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,240
I mean, oh, I can't have both?

1198
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,310
OK, so anyway.

1199
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,376
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

1200
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,940
PROFESSOR: My poor diagram.

1201
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,654
I knew you well.

1202
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:56,570
Yeah so, there you go.

1203
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,740
See, just looking at
these numbers here

1204
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,060
you can add them
up and you get 730

1205
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,390
and it doesn't mean anything.

1206
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,950
No, I'm kidding.

1207
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,660
You can see these
numbers, they just

1208
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,316
don't make sense
for econ strategies.

1209
00:47:07,316 --> 00:47:08,440
They just don't make sense.

1210
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,550
So, what we might
do, and what I've

1211
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,690
been telling the others I would
like to do, is set nuke to 600,

1212
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,230
let's say nuke were 600.

1213
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,235
This can stay at-- it
doesn't matter what things

1214
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,610
are in absolute
terms, it matters

1215
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,640
what they are compared
to other terms--

1216
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,780
so the soldier rush,
OK, let's keep that 400.

1217
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:28,460
The nuke is 600, let's make
the maximum distance 300.

1218
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,660
So now, these are
changing at the same rate,

1219
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,400
the nuke and the distance are
changing at the same rate.

1220
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,270
So nukes will be
no more favored.

1221
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:41,190
What will be favored is now it's
farther to get to the enemy.

1222
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,450
And you still have the
same number of, maybe

1223
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,057
a smaller number of
soldiers relative

1224
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:46,140
to what the other guy has.

1225
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,630
So, this would favor econ.

1226
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,990
If we increase nuke
and the distance then

1227
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,570
that will favor econ strategy.

1228
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,879
And so, then I think
we'll start to see

1229
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,170
some more interesting games
where there's just a couple

1230
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,570
more encampments being taken.

1231
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,130
And this competition is
moving in wonderful directions

1232
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,160
and it's moving that way
under the fiery engines

1233
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,920
of your spirit.

1234
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,200
Thank you for attending
the last lecture

1235
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,530
and I'll be around here
for questions afterward.
