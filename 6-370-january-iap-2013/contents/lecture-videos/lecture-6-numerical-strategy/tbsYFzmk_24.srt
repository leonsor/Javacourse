8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,530
PROFESSOR: So let's
go ahead and start

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,260
Lecture 6, which is
all about strategy.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,900
And we're going to try
to be numerical about it

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,310
because numbers
make us feel smart.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,230
So strategy is a nebulous thing.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,760
It can't be easily defined,
and very many people

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,190
spend all day talking
about it without giving

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,630
any statistics or
numerical results.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,810
Which I think is quite a
shame because, especially

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,020
in this Battlecode,
we can actually

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,630
do computations and say, OK,
if I build this many of x,

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,890
I can build this many of y.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,300
And we can get to some
pretty interesting results.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,770
I'm going to start out by
just having a seat here,

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,160
and I'm going to talk about
some sort of general stuff.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,820
And then we'll move straight
into numerical strategy, which

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,120
I've got here on the
right of the view screen.

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,710
And you can see, like,
I've implemented Battlecode

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,730
in Mathematica to
a limited extent

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,114
for the express purpose of
showing graphs like these.

28
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:27,030
So we'll get to those.

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,550
Let's talk about
Battlecode a little bit.

30
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,830
The way I see it
is that strategy

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,950
can be expressed as having
a triangle aspect to it

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,180
because you're basically
picking between a technology

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,190
route, an econ route,
and a military route.

34
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,510
And then among military, I like
to try to draw another line.

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,890
And you can sort of imagine this
triangle as being on a plane.

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,780
This is on a plane that's like
perpendicular to this line,

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,890
indicating that you can
sort of be in any of them.

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,450
I could have drawn it
as a triangular prism,

39
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,860
but I chose not to.

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,840
So then this
triangle, you can have

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,980
a defensive military
strategy, or you

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,280
can have an offensive one.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,920
Offensive is spelled that way.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,660
And I also like to populate
this map with even more things

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,770
to make it less clear
what's going on.

46
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,050
So I'm going to put
over here large map,

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,460
and I'm going to put
over down here small map.

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,450
Because if you're
on a small map,

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,920
you want to have more
military, at least early on.

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,660
I mean, this is
all time-changing.

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,086
So you could describe a
strategy in time as being like,

52
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,960
OK, first, I'm going to
do a lot of military,

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,619
and then I'm going
to get some econ,

54
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,910
and then I'm going to get tech.

55
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,060
So like that's a strategy,
though it looks pretty weird.

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,560
That looks pretty weird, and
it's crossing out my small map.

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Anyway, so small
map, it is really

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,600
another way of saying
it's far to the enemy base

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,459
or it's close.

60
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,750
So on a small map, you can
get right to the enemy base.

61
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,255
You got to be prepared if
they've got a rush strategy.

62
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,550
Maybe what you ought to
do instead of saying,

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,960
OK, I'm going to use
the map size, is do

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,140
sort of a heuristic.

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,850
Because you could
imagine this map--

66
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm going to do
example maps here--

67
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,320
and this map
currently identical.

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,040
Now let's make them different.

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,020
This one's got
like tons of mines,

70
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,800
and this one has a
little bit of mines.

71
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,150
Obviously, they're different.

72
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,760
I mean, if the headquarters
are here and here in these two

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,670
maps, well, this one is
effectively a small map,

74
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,600
and this one is
effectively a large map.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,250
So here's a suggestion.

76
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,060
It's not very expensive to
sense mines at location.

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,190
It costs 10 in the
MethodCosts.txt file.

78
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,380
So you could consider
saying, all right,

79
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,680
I'm this headquarters.

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,190
For the first couple
of rounds, I'm

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,060
going to compute the sum of
the number of mines between me

82
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,240
and the enemy in sort of a
volume looking like that.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,790
And so I'm just going
to compute this number,

84
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,310
just going to total it all up.

85
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,615
If the map is, say, 50 by
50, then how many tiles

86
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,600
do you need to count?

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,720
Well, say you make it 4
wide, just for halibut.

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
And then down in
this direction, I

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,529
guess it would end up
being sort of like 50.

90
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,880
So you'd have about 200
tiles to look at times 10.

91
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,880
That's going to be 10
bytecodes per sense tile,

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,550
and so you've only got 2,000.

93
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,520
You can do that
easily in one turn

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,740
because the bytecode
limit is 10,000.

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,410
So then you could very
quickly get an estimate

96
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,810
of how easy or difficult
it is to get to your enemy

97
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,740
right off there.

98
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,860
And so then you
could find your spot,

99
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,290
say, OK, I'm here or
here on my Tech Tree.

100
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,690
The system doesn't have to
be incredibly complicated.

101
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,080
So let's delete
some of this mess

102
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,820
that I've made
here so that I can

103
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,340
make some notes
about the differences

104
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,400
between defensive and
offensive strategy.

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,350
Later on, we're going to
see the number of units

106
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,250
that you can get if you're
pushing for an early advantage,

107
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,980
and that's going to
sort of tie into this.

108
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,250
So there's a time
aspect, where you're

109
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,410
saying, if you're defending,
you have a number of advantages.

110
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,160
One is that you can have
additional units up at the time

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,530
when the enemy arrives.

112
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,720
Another is that the
pathing is much easier

113
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,380
because you don't
have to go anywhere.

114
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,040
You can establish a
better concave in theory

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,056
because the enemy might
have to defuse mines.

116
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:37,680
It's worth noting
here that, of course,

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,950
you're not guaranteed
this advantage

118
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,170
because the enemy
knows where you are.

119
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,700
You're sort of around
your headquarters.

120
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,690
I mean, it's generally true that
if you can recognize the enemy

121
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,850
is around his headquarters,
so he's all sort of

122
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,340
clumped up here.

123
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,910
Well, it's pretty easy
for you to say, all right,

124
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm going to stay at a
distance r from that enemy,

125
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,560
and I'm just going to
sort of group up there.

126
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,010
And as soon as everybody is
within a distance r and not

127
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,425
farther than a distance
this other letter,

128
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,860
then I know that I'm in a good
position to attack all at once.

129
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,650
And so if the enemy's just sort
of hiding there in its hole,

130
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,220
then that's also a vulnerability
as well as an advantage.

131
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,010
So you could imagine that case.

132
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,540
And you could also
imagine the case

133
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,010
where there's a ton of mines,
and so the minefield is

134
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:36,460
like this giant, thick
thing, which is filled.

135
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,320
And so you're
defending over here.

136
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,960
And yeah, you're defending here,
and the enemy's coming at you.

137
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,700
And they kind of
have to go in a line

138
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,540
because it's such
a big mine field,

139
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,010
so you can just
sort surround them.

140
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,926
Yeah, I meant to do that
outlining on purpose.

141
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,660
Oh, my goodness.

142
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,090
Who can use Microsoft Paint?

143
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,560
I certainly can.

144
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,220
Let's see here.

145
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,340
So yeah, there's
this concave issue.

146
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,355
And then there's
another issue that you

147
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:07,760
can have the base take hits.

148
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,730
So your base has 500 hit points.

149
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,600
So you can use that
as a sort of buffer

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,870
to try to protect your robot.

151
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,510
It's a very good idea,
but it would spread out

152
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,790
the damage a little bit.

153
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,390
So in the event of
an emergency, it

154
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,800
could be superior to being
farther from your base.

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,230
Also consider that it's
easier to heal your robots

156
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,927
because you're going to have
this area sort of established.

157
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,510
You're going to know
where things are.

158
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,035
You're going to have a safe
path to the nearest medbay

159
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:36,910
that you might build.

160
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,830
And later on we're going to
look at the effects of building

161
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,992
medbay versus other things.

162
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:43,200
It's going to be really good.

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,270
So these are just sort of
a first look at things.

164
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,270
There's some other
stuff in here,

165
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,140
like about tactical withdrawal.

166
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,130
When do you realize that
everything's gone to shit,

167
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,550
and you've got to back out?

168
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,320
What's the value of preserving
your units versus the penalty

169
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,940
of having them not in combat?

170
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,990
They're in transit
between wherever they are

171
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,250
and the medical bays
that you've built.

172
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,420
Because you could easily
imagine filling the whole

173
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,270
map with medical bays just
to reduce that transit time.

174
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,020
And would that be worth
it compared to just not

175
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,420
having them go to medbay
or only engaging in battles

176
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,200
within a certain
range of the medbay?

177
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,560
So you might actually
be retreating to a range

178
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,280
rather than directly
to the thing itself.

179
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
These are things
that you'll probably

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,100
end up thinking about
if you haven't already.

181
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,549
Let's jump straight
into some simulations.

182
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,720
So what I've done
in this model--

183
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,145
let me zoom in just
a little bit-- is

184
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:46,890
I've got a system where
you can build bots.

185
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,360
Bots will die if you have
less than zero resources.

186
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,329
You can build generators,
as you can see here.

187
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,120
I mean, I'm not expecting
you to read this.

188
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,990
But just showing you the
parts that are in the model

189
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,779
so that when you look
at the model results,

190
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,320
you can see for yourself whether
you think they're realistic.

191
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,900
So you can build generators.

192
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,980
And as in the game,
the generators

193
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,140
will provide you an additional
10 resources per turn.

194
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,620
And the cost of
building a generator

195
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,660
is 20 times the
number of encampments

196
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,870
that are currently built.

197
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,600
And here's plus 1 for
the additional one

198
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,060
that you're building.

199
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,870
Same thing applies
for suppliers.

200
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,180
It's got the same build cost.

201
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,610
But instead, it's advantage
is that the spawn time then

202
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,770
becomes this number.

203
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,330
Note that this is different
from what it was in Lecture 1.

204
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,580
In Lecture 1, the spawn
time was 10-- it was this.

205
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,514
It was 10 times 0.95 to the
power of supplier number,

206
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,930
where supplier number is the
number of suppliers you have.

207
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,250
That's what it used to be.

208
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,920
But it's been switched
to this number

209
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
in order to make it slightly
worse, because it was too good.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,170
This and the other changes have
been updated on the Battlecode

211
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,097
data sheet that I
made that you might

212
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,180
remember from the website.

213
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,096
So if you're using that,
make sure that you've

214
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:03,070
updated recently.

215
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,000
And when you download
it, hit F5 or Refresh,

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,990
because it has the same
file name as before.

217
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,860
So your computer might
not download it again

218
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,500
unless you specifically
tell it to.

219
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,041
That's just something
to worry about.

220
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,545
Because it's terrible to be
on a bad version of the specs

221
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:16,920
because then you
think I'm wrong,

222
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,970
and that's just very, very
hard to handle for me.

223
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,830
So here's your spawn time here.

224
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,920
So that's what your
suppliers are doing for you.

225
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,070
And so I've made this model that
tries to build these things,

226
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,550
tries to build robots, and
it kills the excess ones.

227
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,050
So we're trying to reach
a large number of robots.

228
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,830
to Zoom out just
a little bit here.

229
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,070
So you can see here that
we've got power over time,

230
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,464
and this is for 500 rounds.

231
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:46,880
I've got it so
that you can change

232
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,130
the length of the simulation.

233
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,340
And we're going to see quite
a number of simulations

234
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,840
here today.

235
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,250
So you could see here
that, at first, you

236
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,290
start out with no power.

237
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,760
I don't know if this is 100%
realistic because I think

238
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,660
in the game you might actually
start out with full power

239
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,950
to begin with.

240
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,575
But that's a transient effect.

241
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,950
I wouldn't really
worry about it.

242
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,300
We're physicists here.

243
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,750
We talk about
orders of magnitude.

244
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,290
Yes.

245
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,080
So you could see here that
initially your power decays

246
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,770
upward to some
relatively stable value.

247
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,210
But it begins to decrease
as you build robots,

248
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,760
because as the number of
robots increases over time,

249
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,340
the upkeep is increasing.

250
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,800
And so you're decaying downward
to stable values as you go.

251
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,580
And then it becomes a
stable number of robots

252
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,590
as they are produced, and then
they also run out of energy.

253
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,130
So I've also plotted down
here the maximum number

254
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,840
of robots that are achieved
within a simulation.

255
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,050
So this shows that you hit
40 robots at round 391.

256
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,000
We're going to end up
looking at this quantity

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,170
and trying to see how
we can make the most

258
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,780
robots at the
shortest round number.

259
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,850
Or how we can have a trade-off
between maybe getting

260
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,350
the most robots
at an early number

261
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,670
or getting more robots
at a later number, which

262
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,920
would embody the
difference between a rush

263
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,020
strategy and an econ strategy.

264
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,820
I've also plotted
the spawn time so

265
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,030
that you can see how
the effect of suppliers

266
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,180
is changing how long it
takes for robots to spawn.

267
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,700
In this example, there
aren't any suppliers,

268
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,730
so the spawn time is flat.

269
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,439
So let's change the
example a little bit.

270
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,021
I'm going to zoom
out just a tiny bit,

271
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,290
making everything illegible,
so that you can see also

272
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,140
the inputs to this
function that I've made.

273
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,550
And so I'm going to make it
so that the bytecode usage is

274
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,470
5,000.

275
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,610
And what effect
should that have?

276
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,600
It should decrease the number
of robots that we can sustain.

277
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,720
And sure enough, we see
that when we run it,

278
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,120
the maximum number we hit is
now 27 robots at round 261.

279
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,776
So we've hit there sooner,
but it's a smaller number.

280
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,110
It's just worse in every way.

281
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,650
You want to save bytecodes.

282
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,530
So let's go back
to that example.

283
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,560
Now, generator built
rounds and supplier

284
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,520
built rounds is the number of
rounds between every time it

285
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,610
will attempt to build a
generator or a supplier.

286
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,660
This is the basic version
that I started with.

287
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,127
So let's start by building
generators every 10 rounds.

288
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,460
This is assuming that there
are enough generators around

289
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,740
for us to build on.

290
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,320
So you can see here that the
first generator is built around

291
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,850
here.

292
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,184
There's a tiny dip, and
here's another and another.

293
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:12,600
But the generator
doesn't actually

294
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,790
kick in and start to take
effect until 50 turns later

295
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,360
because there's a capture delay,
and it doesn't do anything

296
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,010
while it's being captured.

297
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,390
Then once these are
captured, the amount of power

298
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,890
you have skyrockets.

299
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,240
So this was the
previous maximum of 200.

300
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,450
And now we're up to 2,000
power in just 500 rounds.

301
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,520
This shows that you can really
amplify your economy rapidly.

302
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,210
You'll notice here that
the sawtooth behavior

303
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,380
is becoming increasingly severe.

304
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,070
This is because each
one of these motions

305
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,690
downward indicates the purchase
of yet another generator, which

306
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,160
costs more than the last.

307
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,280
Because as I mentioned
before, the cost

308
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,052
of capturing an encampment is 20
times the number of encampments

309
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:54,760
you have already.

310
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,080
So that's going to
linearly increase.

311
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,350
You could see that it's
recovering faster and faster

312
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,530
though because, as
has been mentioned,

313
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,300
the generators do produce
10 energy per turn.

314
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,830
So here we can see that
it's not hitting any limit

315
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,580
to the number of robots
that can be built.

316
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,660
And if we extend the
simulation out to 2,000 rounds,

317
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,690
we can see that it just
continues on as it was before,

318
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,780
and the number of
robots is unlimited.

319
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,370
So if you do find a map that
has a whole lot of encampments

320
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,360
to capture-- and we
haven't specified

321
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,330
that there's a maximum
number of encampments

322
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,610
as far as I know--
then you could end up

323
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,270
just continuing to
build these things.

324
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,800
And then it doesn't matter
how terrible your micro is

325
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,180
or how terrible your tech
is because you'll just

326
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,020
overwhelm the enemy.

327
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,880
Hey, look, at round
1991, what a good year.

328
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,080
That's pretty special.

329
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,780
So let's go back
down to 500 where

330
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,360
we can see what's going on,
and let's change generator

331
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,510
built rounds to 1.

332
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,290
So now we're going to try to
build a generator every round.

333
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,340
But look at here.

334
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,010
These red dots indicating
the completion of generators

335
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,970
are non-uniformly spaced.

336
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,590
That seems to
indicate that it's not

337
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,950
able to build
generators every turn.

338
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,750
That's because there's
not enough power.

339
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,270
You can see here that the
power is as close to 0

340
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,560
as it possibly can
without destroying robots

341
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,930
from bringing it down
to negative values.

342
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,360
So you can see here
that you can now

343
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,480
get to have more robots than
you otherwise would have.

344
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,447
No, that's not true.

345
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:21,530
You can't have any more
robots because we're still

346
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,820
limited by the rate at which
they're being produced.

347
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,850
They're only being produced
one every 10 rounds,

348
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,970
and that's really cramping
our style, as it were.

349
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,790
So let's increase this
back up to a million

350
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,260
so that it's not building
any more generators.

351
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,290
Let's try building
just suppliers.

352
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,990
So let's build a
supplier every 10 rounds.

353
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,800
As you can see here,
here's the money

354
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,650
being expended on suppliers.

355
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,840
And pretty soon, even
before round 100,

356
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,640
we start hitting a point where
the number of robots we have,

357
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,500
which is accelerating over
time as the spawn time

358
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,100
is decreasing, the
number of robots going up

359
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,360
is preventing us from
getting enough power

360
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,100
to continue building suppliers.

361
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
So we're actually capped.

362
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,030
This behavior, where the
power goes down and crashes,

363
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,440
is going to really hurt our
ability to play the game.

364
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,630
It becomes exacerbated the
faster you build suppliers.

365
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,850
Because you see here, I built
these suppliers, and then,

366
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,570
bingo.

367
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,040
I've only built a total
of-- let's see here,

368
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,700
supplier number, I've built
a total of eight suppliers

369
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,050
within the first, I don't
know, this looks like 40 turns.

370
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,830
And now I'm not going
to be able to build

371
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,680
anything else for
the whole game,

372
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,760
because the next encampment
that I buy would cost 8 times 20

373
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,590
is 160, plus 20 for the next
one, is going to be 180.

374
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,740
I simply can't afford
that if my power is never

375
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,770
exceeding 170 over here.

376
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,460
So that's pretty much going
to be a crippling blow.

377
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,880
So maybe, as my player, I
need to do one of two things.

378
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,780
One, maybe I should build
suppliers and generators.

379
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,610
Two, I could notice that
maybe the enemy has killed

380
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,430
a bunch of my generators, but I
still have suppliers left over.

381
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,626
Have you thought about that?

382
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,000
Maybe some of your
suppliers will

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,540
have to destroy
themselves to make room

384
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,250
for more power generation.

385
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,790
It could be something that
happens to you less than not

386
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,200
ever, or which is to say
more often than not ever.

387
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,460
So let's make it 10 and 10.

388
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,919
So we're trying to
do some of each.

389
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:20,168
Well, it's not really working.

390
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:22,130
It's like building some,
and then the others

391
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,970
because one of them is taking
precedence over the first.

392
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,329
Maybe we'll try building these
every 20 and these every 10.

393
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,870
Well, now it's
building some of each.

394
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,280
This is not so bad.

395
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,880
So now we're getting
to 76 robots at 496.

396
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,850
Our power is going up,
but we're not so much

397
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,620
wasting it as we were before.

398
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,120
And we can see that the spawn
time has gone all the way down

399
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,110
to half.

400
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,640
Now, this does assume
that none of your robots

401
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,860
are being destroyed.

402
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,880
If you're actively
losing robots,

403
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,370
it makes perfect sense
to build only suppliers

404
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,660
because, at that point,
you can clump up your units

405
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,900
and lose them, which
will give you the money

406
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,260
to continue building units.

407
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,450
It's only when you've favored
suppliers and then not attacked

408
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,020
that you're wasting
your effort and time.

409
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,560
So this is something that I
saw in some of the scrimmage

410
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,020
matches that I've
been looking at,

411
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,840
because we devs have access to
all kinds of secret information

412
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,189
about you, including
the performance

413
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,730
of your players in
scrimmage matches.

414
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,040
And so I've been downloading
these maps and looking at them.

415
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,430
And in these
matches, I've tended

416
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,580
to see that, a lot
of times, we're

417
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,957
favoring suppliers
but not attacking.

418
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:23,540
Other times, we're
favoring suppliers,

419
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,990
and we're just sending
our units one by one

420
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,820
to be killed by the enemy blob.

421
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,470
I think that's also sub-optimal.

422
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,680
But at the same
time, we have seen

423
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,300
quite a few good strategies.

424
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,470
I've seen some great
pathing, and I've

425
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,660
seen some great
solving for the map.

426
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,494
I think that there's a
lot to be done there.

427
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,076
And I have confidence
that we're going

428
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:44,440
to see a lot of great matches
in the sprint tournament.

429
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,540
So let's go back to the
model here and look again

430
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,490
at maybe getting a build order.

431
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,020
So here, the build
order I'm defining as,

432
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,580
what order do you get
suppliers and generators?

433
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,840
This way of doing it, as you
see I've implemented it here,

434
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,200
is kind of inefficient,
because whichever

435
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,810
one goes first is
just whichever one

436
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,720
hit the round
counter or something.

437
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,970
So here I re-implement the
whole system with an explicit

438
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,150
build order.

439
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,560
So I can say, all right,
please give me a bunch of 2,

440
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,050
and then give me 2 and then
1 in alternating turns.

441
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,740
So you can see here-- it's
not working very well--

442
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,100
2 is my number for
the supplier, and 1

443
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,240
is my indicator
for the generator.

444
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,830
So here we do five 2's, and then
we alternate 2 and 1 forever.

445
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,665
So there are the five 2's, and
then we've got a 2, 1, and a 2,

446
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:36,690
and a 1.

447
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,010
Well, that's not very good
because we still crash,

448
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,490
and we only hit a
maximum of 57 robots.

449
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,570
So let's consider reducing
this number of 2's.

450
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,010
Well, that's much better.

451
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,035
So now we've gotten up
to 87 robots around 495.

452
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,410
Now, if you've
been keeping track

453
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,060
in your mind of which
number of robots

454
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,990
we've hit at which
round, congratulations.

455
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,606
You're much better
at that than me.

456
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,230
Later on, I'm going
to be showing plots

457
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,690
so that we don't have to
memorize how many robots we

458
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,940
have at what round.

459
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,600
But for the sake
of illustration,

460
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,150
it's pretty useful to be
able to say, all right, if I

461
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,740
add one more supplier here,
how does that help me?

462
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,570
Well, if you look
very carefully,

463
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,232
it's going to shift your
early number of robots up,

464
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,690
and it's probably going to
shift your late number of robots

465
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,189
down.

466
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:18,900
That's the way it's
changing the shape.

467
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,490
So you can see here that
that's a very subtle change.

468
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,910
Let's change it so that we're
only building suppliers,

469
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,020
and then we're only
building generators.

470
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,000
So there we've built a
few suppliers, and then

471
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,280
a lot of generators.

472
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,770
That's 62 robots.

473
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,480
We can keep changing it and try.

474
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,700
Here's a few more suppliers.

475
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,491
Well, look at that.

476
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:38,210
We never got the chance to
build any generators because we

477
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,340
ran out of energy when we
were building suppliers.

478
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,790
This is the same issue
that we were seeing before.

479
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,730
So let's explore the
space automatically.

480
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,350
This is kind of weird.

481
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,130
What I'm going to
show you is a plot

482
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,960
of the peak number
of robots that you've

483
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,799
gotten during the simulation
versus the number of rounds.

484
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,340
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

485
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,140
to sort of move along the
space in some line, which

486
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,340
is going to be an automatic
search for these various things

487
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,950
that we're looking for.

488
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,220
So yeah, so where do you
want to be on this graph?

489
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,270
You want to be up
here at the upper left

490
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,670
because that means that
you're getting a lot of robots

491
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,920
at a small number of rounds.

492
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,240
This is the phenomenon
that we were seeing before,

493
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,344
where going from
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8--

494
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:23,010
you could see that it's skipping
some numbers because they would

495
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,720
have written over one another.

496
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,950
Yeah, I'll show it
with all the numbers.

497
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:31,830
Well, that's odd.

498
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,450
It changed shape.

499
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,300
Ba, ba da, ba, ba,
ba, ba, ba, ba.

500
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,680
Well, let's go with it.

501
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,690
So this example is-- did I
define the explicit system?

502
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,720
This is the explicit
system here.

503
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,160
Did I set that?

504
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,250
And then did I define it?

505
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,810
Well, all right,
that's how it is.

506
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,610
So this system is showing
you from 0 up to 15

507
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,630
for every time it's
trying a longer

508
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,160
or a shorter system of
building the suppliers.

509
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,120
So if it says 0,
it means it just

510
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,650
goes straight into generators.

511
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,540
And if it says a
higher number, then it

512
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,450
has built that many suppliers
before it goes into generators.

513
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,020
So you could see,
yeah, so that's there.

514
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,322
And the numbers sort of
start to overlap one another,

515
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,780
so I made this little function
that gets rid of the numbers

516
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,600
if they're too close
to another number.

517
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,211
And that changed the way
it looked quite a bit.

518
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:27,925
[INAUDIBLE] 2,000 at the bottom
if you take that [INAUDIBLE]?

519
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:29,440
I see, I see.

520
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,660
It was going out to 2,000.

521
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,050
Thank you, thank you.

522
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,240
So let's make this, yeah,
let's make this just to 1,000.

523
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,250
Strategy exploration is there.

524
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,820
Simplified exploration is here.

525
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,760
Yeah.

526
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
So there are the numbers.

527
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,470
And this phenomenon is the thing
that we've been seeing before,

528
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,840
that as you have more and
more suppliers to begin with,

529
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,530
it's OK up to a
point, at which you

530
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,230
can't build any more robots.

531
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,480
And you hit a limit because
you've run out of power.

532
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:56,980
OK.

533
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,900
That's what we've
seen, seen it 100 ways.

534
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,720
That's good.

535
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,450
Let's switch to a mix of things.

536
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,370
So instead of doing
all one, we do a mix

537
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,540
so that we're alternating
one and the other.

538
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,640
So in this example,
we're starting

539
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,490
with i numbers of
suppliers, and then we're

540
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,840
going to follow it
up with alternating

541
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,540
generators and suppliers.

542
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,290
And you can see
here that the best

543
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,680
result seems to be something.

544
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,180
I mean, you really
can't decide just

545
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,340
based on this graph because
these are maximum points.

546
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,400
And if this is 8,
is that a better way

547
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,690
to operate for a rush strategy?

548
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,700
Well, here's a way of
addressing that question.

549
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,130
Here I've plotted
the number of robots

550
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,479
versus the round for this 0.

551
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,020
And you can see here
that it's always

552
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,060
above the other
peak robot counts.

553
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,040
So that indicates that
it's definitively better

554
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,980
to start building generators
before you start building

555
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,070
suppliers, at least if you're
aiming for the peak robot

556
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,570
condition.

557
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,020
You're trying to get the
greatest number of robots.

558
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,130
So there you go.

559
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,440
It's better always to use zero.

560
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,480
And here if we compare
different strategies,

561
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,040
we can see them
on the same space.

562
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,620
And one is obviously better.

563
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,750
This one above here that's new
is much better than the one

564
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,350
we had before.

565
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,750
It gets us more robots
at the same round number.

566
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,750
And again, we're trying
to get to the upper left

567
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,860
of this graph.

568
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,460
This strategy consists
of building a generator,

569
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,300
and then building
a supplier i times.

570
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,450
So we'll do that set i
times, and then we'll

571
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,795
go into building 1, 2, 2.

572
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,920
So then we'll be building
a generator for every two

573
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,210
suppliers.

574
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,570
And we could see that this
is much better at any point.

575
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,755
So that's pretty interesting.

576
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:39,880
That is pretty interesting.

577
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,620
Because then we
can say, all right,

578
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,430
I've played around with this.

579
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,960
Maybe it's better to have three.

580
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,870
Is that even better?

581
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,730
We'll see, we'll see.

582
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,450
That changes the
shape a little bit.

583
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,830
So that gives me a bit of an
improvement in this region.

584
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,270
So if we really want to have
the most robots at this round,

585
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,865
possibly the best way to
do it is to start here.

586
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,320
And I know that these are
all pretty obscure-looking,

587
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,610
so I'm going to just skip
straight on down to over here,

588
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,930
where we can look at
the effect of a rush.

589
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,960
And we can see it
very concretely

590
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,050
that, in this example, we've
got the first guy in blue.

591
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,330
He's building only
generators for 40 rounds,

592
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,790
and then he's going to
start building suppliers.

593
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,160
So there you can see blue
is building only generators,

594
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,743
and then he starts
building suppliers.

595
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:29,970
And his robot production
rate increases.

596
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,510
Here in red, the red guy is
starting by building suppliers.

597
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,870
And so you can see he caps out
at 41 suppliers, or 41 robots

598
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,490
for a moment, and then
he's back to oscillating.

599
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,990
So he's got a military advantage
in this window starting

600
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,500
from round 100 going up to
round 300, where, for a time,

601
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,650
he's going to
outnumber the enemy.

602
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,500
And his goal is to
win during this time.

603
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,120
So if you outnumber the
enemy starting at round 100

604
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,140
and going to 300, here's
what you have to do.

605
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,960
You have to get to the enemy
and start shooting at him.

606
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,670
So if the map is
really, really big,

607
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,009
like if the map
is 100, size 100,

608
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,425
you don't have the
pickax upgrade.

609
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:17,470
So you're going to be defusing
mines at 12 rounds per mine.

610
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,694
If you've got 50 mines
in the way and 12 each,

611
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:22,610
there's no way that
you're going to get there.

612
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,550
Because it's going to
take you 500 rounds just

613
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,091
to get to the enemy,
and you'll never

614
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:27,970
actually get to start shooting.

615
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,320
But if you can find a
straight path to your enemy,

616
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,570
even if the map
is 50 units long,

617
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,950
you can get there and start
capitalizing on your unit

618
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,560
advantage before his
econ play kicks in.

619
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,392
So there you go, a
very concrete example

620
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,177
of the effects of rushing
or playing an econ.

621
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:44,760
At the same time,
you could definitely

622
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,499
imagine intermediate strategies.

623
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:48,290
So here I'm just going
to go ahead and plot

624
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,670
a third strategy, which
maybe I'll make in green.

625
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,600
And maybe this strategy
is a mix of the two.

626
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,380
So instead of starting with just
generators or just suppliers,

627
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,470
we'll do a combination of
generators and suppliers.

628
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,180
Now look at that.

629
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,550
That's pretty interesting.

630
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,030
Let's extend the simulation
length to 800 rounds,

631
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,470
and we'll be able
to see the effects.

632
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,600
So now we see that the green
player does almost as well

633
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,510
as the red player.

634
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,850
It's almost indistinguishable
at this distance.

635
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,410
And given the
defensive advantage

636
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,040
we talked about earlier, it may
be enough for the green player

637
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,060
to hold off.

638
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,400
He'll still be able to
smash the red player.

639
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,950
And he's still got an
advantage over the blue player

640
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,340
without being that
much at a disadvantage.

641
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,570
That is to say that the
green advantage lasts

642
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,330
until about round 600.

643
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,270
Let's zoom in a little bit
so that we can see round 600

644
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,320
and try to assess how much
better the green player is

645
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,385
than the blue player.

646
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:43,680
So here, once again,
green is building

647
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,230
alternating generators
and suppliers.

648
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,240
And he has an
advantage over blue

649
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,540
starting at about round 100
and going to about round 450.

650
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,040
That's a pretty big
round and that's

651
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,360
a pretty big advantage
for a pretty long time.

652
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,400
It's only at that time that
blue begins to take off

653
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,490
and gets a serious advantage.

654
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,150
So you can see here that there's
a pretty significant difference

655
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,510
between different
strategies and that you

656
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,900
can achieve a significant
difference of units.

657
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,080
But how many different
differences of units

658
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,920
are important to start
really making a difference?

659
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,650
I mean, if you have 10
units versus their 11,

660
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,040
how good is that?

661
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,130
Is that a lot?

662
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,755
Is it a little?

663
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:24,512
It doesn't seem like very much.

664
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:25,970
Well, to answer
that question, I've

665
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,550
made yet another simulation.

666
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,920
Because why not do a simulation?

667
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,750
Simulations are fun.

668
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,910
So here's a look at it.

669
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,377
And what I've made here is
sort of a very basic simulator

670
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:38,710
that works in the following way.

671
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm going to zoom
in a little bit.

672
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,536
So this is some
combat, and I'm going

673
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:45,139
to simulate the combat
between 10 and 11 units.

674
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm going to do it
a couple of times.

675
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,525
I'll start out doing
it slowly, so I'm

676
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:50,900
decreasing the
compute time here.

677
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,005
So there's 11 units
on the bottom,

678
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:54,490
and these are their hit points.

679
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,100
And there are 10
units on the top.

680
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,350
I'm going to do it once again.

681
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,766
I'm going to start
with 10 and 10.

682
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:02,360
This is team A on top
and team B on bottom.

683
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,950
As you can see here,
that when there

684
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,480
are the same number of
units, they all lose

685
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,190
hit points at the same
rate, and they all

686
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,080
die at the same time, at
least in my simulation.

687
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,130
When there's an advantage,
that extra robot that you have

688
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,910
can start dealing additional
damage to his robots.

689
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,500
And so that advantage becomes
more significant over time.

690
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,840
So if we have 100
units versus 101 units,

691
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,390
then we'll be here all day.

692
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,040
But the point is
that you'll end up

693
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,840
seeing a more and
more significant

694
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,880
difference between the two.

695
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,860
That didn't seem to work
quite right, did it?

696
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,290
But perhaps it did.

697
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,160
It may just have the
exact same result.

698
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,036
I'd be quite curious.

699
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,743
Well, in any case,
we're going to go back

700
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:41,370
to the example we
were showing before.

701
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,050
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to say, OK, when you have

702
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,920
10 versus 11, the 11 team
ends up with four units left.

703
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,000
And two of them are very low
hit points, but two of them

704
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,730
have a lot of the
points remaining.

705
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,880
So we can start to define two
quantities, the robot kill

706
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,890
ratio and the HP kill ratio.

707
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,760
So the robot kill ratio is
to say I put in 11 units,

708
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,760
and I got out four
of mine remaining.

709
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,890
So 11 is the bottom.

710
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,620
I got four remaining,
so that cost me seven.

711
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,680
But in the process
of costing me seven,

712
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,200
I was able to take
out 10 enemy units.

713
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,536
So that's 10 divided
by 7, and if we

714
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,410
make it numerical with
a decimal point there,

715
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,201
we see that number.

716
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,420
Question.

717
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,270
Yeah, how [INAUDIBLE]?

718
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,220
So I'm actually
modeling the combat

719
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,720
by distributing
the attack evenly

720
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,030
from one side and the other.

721
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,730
And then any remaining units
will have the opportunity

722
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,950
to deal more damage
to the enemy team.

723
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,390
So I don't know exactly
how accurate it is.

724
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,070
And if you can manage to
maintain a tight choke point,

725
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,130
then you can trade
evenly with your enemy.

726
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,470
But that's the best you can
do if you're outnumbered.

727
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,824
If you have the advantage
and you surround the enemy,

728
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:54,490
then you could do
even better than this.

729
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,280
This is something like a middle
ground between those two cases.

730
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,610
Good question.

731
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,840
If you want to see the
actual way that it works,

732
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,210
learn Mathematica and read
the code that's right here.

733
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,950
So we see here that there's
the robot kill ratio.

734
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,520
That's pretty good.

735
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,300
We came to the fight with
10% additional units,

736
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,730
and we end up getting 40%
more value out of our units

737
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,825
that we lost.

738
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:22,830
On a hit point basis, we didn't
get that much of an advantage.

739
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,630
Bringing a 10% advantage got
us 6% hit point advantage

740
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,840
on how many hit points we were
able to lose versus the enemy.

741
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,750
So let's look at
a lot of results.

742
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,440
So here on the left,
I made a table.

743
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,650
So I've just done the simulation
for 20 units versus i units,

744
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,960
where i goes from 21 to 30.

745
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,510
So you can see the force ratio
that I'm bringing to the table.

746
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,140
Here I'm imagining that I
have more than the enemy.

747
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,140
But of course, you can
just invert these numbers

748
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,810
and get the reverse case.

749
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,080
The force ratio I'm bringing is
5% extra, 10% extra, and so on,

750
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,630
and that achieves
these unit kill ratios.

751
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,750
You can see here I've
capped it out at 20,000

752
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,870
so that it doesn't
display the infinity sign.

753
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,970
Because here, once you have more
than 1/3 more than the enemy,

754
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,790
you don't lose any units
at all during combat.

755
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,100
That's according to the
simulation that I've set up.

756
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,720
A pretty amazing
result if you ask me.

757
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,500
So you can see here that the
unit kill ratio magnifies quite

758
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,530
intensely.

759
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,470
The hit point kill ratio
doesn't magnify that intensely.

760
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,670
So here, 5% force ratio gets
you about 20% unit kill.

761
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,670
10% gets you 40%.

762
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,450
15% gets you 80% extra.

763
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,620
And then once you get
up higher, it just

764
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,150
ramps up more from there.

765
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,700
So it shows that even it's
a fight of five versus four,

766
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,690
it's probably a very bad
idea to engage the enemy.

767
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,860
Because you're not going to be
able to kill any of their units

768
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,460
before they kill all of yours,
which means that all of theirs

769
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,310
can sort of head
back to a medbay,

770
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,510
get healed up, and then
be back to the fight.

771
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,480
It's worth mentioning here
that the medbay can end up

772
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,630
being as productive
as your headquarters.

773
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:06,260
So let's go back up to where
I've talked about the medbay.

774
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,480
Let's talk about it here.

775
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,690
So let's talk about the
production abilities

776
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,380
of your various capabilities.

777
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,610
You've got your
headquarters, which

778
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,240
is making units at
40 hit points each.

779
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,430
And let's say that it produces
them every 10 rounds, or maybe

780
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,380
every 5 rounds at best if
you've got a lot of suppliers.

781
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,400
So this is your
headquarters building units.

782
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,410
So it's building hit
points every turn.

783
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,240
So it's building from four
to eight hit points per turn.

784
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,630
Well, that's not too bad.

785
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,980
That's building four to
eight hit points per turn.

786
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,860
But what about everything else?

787
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,350
A medbay can heal two
hit points for every

788
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,750
of the adjacent units.

789
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,660
So that there, right there--
if you can multiply correctly--

790
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,610
it's 16 hit points per turn.

791
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,180
That's so many.

792
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,470
That's the value of two
headquarters right there,

793
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,640
even considering headquarters
at full supplier capacity.

794
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,810
That just shows that even
if you're using medbays

795
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,850
incorrectly or doing it wrong in
the various ways that you can,

796
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,580
you'll still be doing a much
better job than a headquarters

797
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,279
alone.

798
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,070
I mean, that's ignoring
the fact that there

799
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,239
are other things at play here.

800
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,830
Like you have to
have injured units

801
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,230
in order to produce
hit points in a medbay.

802
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,900
But it's certainly
worth mentioning

803
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,179
that even this basic
analysis shows what it is.

804
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,696
Very clear.

805
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,570
Now, what's the killing
ability of artillery?

806
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,236
It's been said that
they're overpowered.

807
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:24,560
Or that they're quite strong,
and they're definitely

808
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,460
worth using.

809
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,320
But is the killing power
of an artillery worth

810
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,810
it compared to the
healing power of a medbay?

811
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,520
Purely from a
numerical standpoint,

812
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,500
you can see here that the
best the artillery can do

813
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,420
is to deal 40 damage to
its target and 20 damage

814
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,980
to each of eight targets
adjacent for a total of 200,

815
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,520
if I did that math correctly.

816
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,040
And it does that every 20 turns,
which is its attack delay.

817
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,948
So that gives us 10
hit points per turn.

818
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:50,489
Look at that.

819
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,929
Oftentimes, 10 less than 16.

820
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:53,947
True.

821
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:55,280
It's even going to tell me that.

822
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,870
[LAUGHTER]

823
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,990
Well, what a big surprise.

824
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,850
So you can make the
decision for yourself.

825
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,900
And of course, each
one has its own uses,

826
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,340
because the artillery
is not always

827
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,980
going to be able to
deal 10 hit points.

828
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,090
Medbay's not always going
to be able to heal units.

829
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,756
Maybe it's too far
from the headquarters

830
00:35:12,756 --> 00:35:14,300
to be a real defensive asset.

831
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:14,846
Maybe not.

832
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,720
There are a lot of
considerations to include.

833
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,340
But doing a
calculation like this

834
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,380
can certainly help you out
in making your decisions.

835
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,140
For example, I mean,
I think it's worth

836
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,590
doing the following check.

837
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,360
Check if there's an
encampment near your base.

838
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,000
If there is, go ahead
and make it a medbay.

839
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,434
If it's not that
near, maybe it's

840
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:32,600
better to make it artillery.

841
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,120
Like if it's adjacent, you
probably want a medbay.

842
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,610
But if it's not
close, the medbay

843
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,090
becomes less and less valuable.

844
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,120
Whereas if it's in
still artillery range,

845
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,679
maybe it's still worth having.

846
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,220
It's the kind of question-- this
is the kind of trade-off you

847
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,178
could make, and you could
just hard-code it in.

848
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:48,700
If it's more than a
distance 16, distance

849
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,510
squared 16, then go
ahead, do it this way.

850
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,180
Otherwise, do it that way.

851
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,450
Very simple way of
addressing the problem.

852
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,810
So let's go back down
and let's talk more

853
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,230
about encounters of units.

854
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,030
So let's continue with this
unit kill ratio results table.

855
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,235
So we're here.

856
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:07,360
And you know, it's kind of
hard to look at numbers.

857
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,980
Oftentimes when people
have a lot of numbers,

858
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,670
especially in a
table, they plot it.

859
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,670
So here I've got a plot.

860
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,540
Doesn't mean that much.

861
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,280
Let's do a list plot
so we've got points.

862
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,160
And so we're asking the
question-- here is the input.

863
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,910
Is that the input?

864
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,870
No, the input, it
goes up to 1.3.

865
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,400
Yeah, the input is here.

866
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,960
So this is having 5% advantage,
10% advantage, and so on.

867
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,700
And the question is,
how many hit points

868
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,630
is that worth for you?

869
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,650
What hit point advantage
does that get you?

870
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,090
And so we could do a best
fit for these results.

871
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,890
So in Mathematica that would
look like-- find a fit.

872
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,936
You put the data in.

873
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:48,870
You put the
expression ax plus b,

874
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,590
where a and b are
the parameters,

875
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,830
and x is the
variable in question.

876
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,940
And this is your fit
rule, and then you

877
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,450
can just apply that
to the expression.

878
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:04,270
And in one line--
we'll have a plot.

879
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,142
So we'll plot this
thing, mess that it is.

880
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,850
Well, OK, why don't
we just call it here.

881
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,400
The line is this, so we're
finding the best fit line here.

882
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,220
And x goes from-- I
don't know-- 0 to 1.5,

883
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,560
and that ought to do it for us.

884
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,700
We'll plot that line, and
we'll plot these points.

885
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,200
So we'll call it
points equals that,

886
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,670
and we'll show the line
together with the points.

887
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,700
And we'll also be able
show other things.

888
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,440
PlotStyle Red.

889
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,970
We'll make the line red
because that's real style.

890
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,660
That's real style.

891
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,070
That almost worked.

892
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,620
There you go.

893
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,980
So there's a line.

894
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,200
What line is that?

895
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,820
It's the line where-- the line.

896
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,340
Please tell me the line.

897
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,174
It's 0.69.

898
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:53,840
So there you go.

899
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,806
The slope here is 0.69.

900
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:58,430
I mean, of course,
this is probably not

901
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,250
valid down at these low numbers.

902
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:08,480
But the point is that for
every additional 1% or one unit

903
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,710
that you add, that's going to be
an extra 0.7 units that you're

904
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,160
going to damage of your enemy.

905
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,710
And it's sort of fairly
linear between 1 and 5.

906
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,740
Let's see if we really
dominate the enemy how

907
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,340
the results will
sort of stack up.

908
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,340
So here it's simulating
a whole bunch of combat,

909
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,570
and it's going really slowly.

910
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,450
Why is it going slowly?

911
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,230
Well, because I put in
like that delay thing

912
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,896
so that you could see
what was going on.

913
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:33,510
So I'm going to
change the delay to 0

914
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,468
and scroll right on back
down, giving everybody

915
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:36,922
in the room nausea.

916
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:38,630
There's also a bunch
of print statements.

917
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,630
So we're seeing like 200
print statements, which

918
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,620
was to print the dynamic
results of the match

919
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,020
so that you could see them
fighting, sort of seeing

920
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,050
numbers decrease on a board,
which is a lot like combat

921
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,590
in the eyes of a nerd.

922
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,720
So then we can see here
a bunch of force ratios.

923
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,680
And here in this example,
we see that we're

924
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,260
maxing out at a certain number.

925
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,290
So according to the way that
I've set up this simulation,

926
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,040
beyond a force
ratio of 2, you're

927
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,630
not getting any
additional advantage

928
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,760
out of your additional
troops because they just

929
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,270
can't find a place to stand.

930
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,160
In reality, when you have four
versus one or eight versus one,

931
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,950
there's a place for
all of your eight guys

932
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,560
to stand around all of
their one poor little guy.

933
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,080
But if you have a
large number of units,

934
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,130
it may be less realistic
to assume that there's

935
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,140
that much room available
for them to double

936
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,280
team, or quadruple team, or
eight-tuple team the enemy.

937
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,486
So you could see here that
these are some results.

938
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:29,860
And now if we plot
them again, we

939
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,240
see that we sort of hit the
ceiling right over here,

940
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,040
and so the line sort
of is totally destroyed

941
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,890
and comes out wrong.

942
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,670
Let's go up to 3 so we
see how bad-looking it is.

943
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,170
And this is just
yet another example

944
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,140
of how doing a best
fit line to something

945
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,840
is not the right answer
100% of the time.

946
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,874
It's the right answer
99.99% of the time.

947
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:53,290
Or basically use the r squared
number to see if it's-- no,

948
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,170
I'm just kidding.

949
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,770
That's not genuine statistics.

950
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,720
And most of you are
probably poo-pooing the idea

951
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,480
that I even considered for
a moment or a nanosecond

952
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,900
including the two words
in the same sentence.

953
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,770
So that's a sort of
summary of these issues.

954
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,440
Like what force ratio
gets you what unit or hit

955
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,630
point kill ratio?

956
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,680
You can see here a big takeaway
lesson that just 25% more units

957
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,860
or just 30% more
units than the enemy

958
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,350
can make a giant difference.

959
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,840
And you should never engage
when you're outnumbered,

960
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,790
unless you're right
next to the headquarters

961
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,482
and there's no choice.

962
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,065
I strongly recommend
that you consider

963
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,470
the little micro-tricks,
trying to get

964
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,590
your units into the
right place, withdrawing

965
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,020
when it's a good idea.

966
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,470
Remember that if you're
retreating from the enemy

967
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,730
and the enemy is
adjacent to you,

968
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,450
that means you can take
damage every turn while you're

969
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,250
retreating.

970
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,930
So in this game, retreating
is definitely not

971
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,370
encouraged for that reason.

972
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,380
What you need is
like allied units

973
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,570
to sort of distract the enemy
while your injured ones are

974
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,290
going to heal.

975
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,960
Or you need to have your
medbays close enough

976
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,490
that you can
survive the retreat.

977
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,180
Because the way the
game works is, you move,

978
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,620
and then you deal attack damage.

979
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,120
So if you retreat
from your enemy,

980
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,789
you're not adjacent to him
anymore after you've moved.

981
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:09,705
And then he moves toward
you and deals damage.

982
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:11,440
And then you retreat, and
you don't deal damage.

983
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,148
And he moves toward
you and deals damage.

984
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:14,820
And it's just a
very bad situation.

985
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,030
I've been in it myself.

986
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,930
It was very painful to watch.

987
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,737
So with that, I mean,
I think that's going

988
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:23,320
to be all that I've
got for you today,

989
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,778
even though it's slightly early
on the days I've gone over.

990
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:27,900
And so I recommend that
you just sort of sit

991
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,290
here, enjoy yourselves,
ask me questions.

992
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,730
And when the Bubble tea
arrives, the deputies

993
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,900
will spring into action.

994
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,385
So thank you very much
for coming to Lecture 6.

995
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:42,080
I guess I should explain what's
going on in the next lectures.

996
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,880
Next lecture is going to be
an exciting guest lecture,

997
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,050
where we've got one of the
developers of Battlecode

998
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,825
who's been remote and
who was the winner

999
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:52,830
of Battlecode last year,
fun gamers, on that team.

1000
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,890
He's coming here to talk about
various important things.

1001
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,460
I forgot what he's--
oh, my goodness.

1002
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,040
What a terrible
plug for his talk.

1003
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,150
It was going to be about-- no,
that wasn't a helpful comment.

1004
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,450
That was just talking.

1005
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,810
Yeah, he's going to talk about,
I think, emergent complexity

1006
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,710
and like really awesome
tricks that you learn

1007
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,860
if you do Battlecode N years,
where N is a large number.
